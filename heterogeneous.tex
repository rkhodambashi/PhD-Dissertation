\chapter{Heterogeneous hydrogel structures as Miniature Hyper-redundant Soft Manipulators}
\label{chap:heterogeneous}
Stimuli-responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time-varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks – referred to as Soft Voxel Actuators (SVAs) –heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations is presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed-solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of PNIPAAm to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young’s Modulus in a simple, one-step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way towards tunable, untethered, and high degree-of-freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured environments.
\section{\capitalisewords{Background}}
Smart hydrogels have attracted great interest in many different fields, such as drug delivery \citesuperscript{Annabi2014, Stuart2010},               
microfluidics \citesuperscript{DEramo2018a,Goy2019}, and soft robotics \citesuperscript{Banerjee2018}, owing to their large and reversible volume changes in response to a broad range of stimuli without using any additional sensors and actuators. This feature helps reduce the size of devices made of smart hydrogels.

Practical soft robotic applications, ranging from basic bending and shortening primitives to complex reconfigurations, all require time-varying and local deformations of bulk hydrogels in order to approach the dexterity of

However, the responsive volume change of smart hydrogels is typically uniform.
% \dma{\sout{to achieve precise and complex reconfigurations}}
Two main approaches have been adopted by researchers to achieve nonuniform spatiotemporal deformation in hydrogels \citesuperscript{Ionov2014}. In the first approach, heterogeneous structures in the shape of sheets and rods are fabricated by patterning material domains using manufacturing techniques such as micro- and meso-patterning \citesuperscript{Zhou2018b,Klein2007,Kim2012,Ma2016a,Erb2013,Huang2017} and 3D printing \citesuperscript{Zheng2018}. Differing swelling properties of neighboring domains upon stimulation results in nonuniform strain fields in these structures, causing them to transform into a variety of complex shapes like coils and conical helices \citesuperscript{Wu2013,Liu2016}.

% Fabrication techniques used for patterning material domains include micro- and meso-patterning\citesuperscript{Zhou2018b,Peng2018,Lee2014,Ma2016a,Erb2013,Huang2017} and 3D printing.

The range of compatible materials available for each domain, however, is often limited by practical fabrication constraints, such as ink viscosity for 3D printing \citesuperscript{Zheng2018}. Moreover, the geometry and material selected for each domain determine the shape transformations; these features cannot be changed after manufacturing, making on-demand reconfiguration infeasible.\\

The second approach towards achieving nonuniform spatiotemporal deformations uses an inhomogeneous or time-varying stimulus, such as patterns of structured light \citesuperscript{Palagi2016}, local irradiation by near-infrared light \citesuperscript{Mourran2017}, or localized electric fields \citesuperscript{Choi2020}. In these methods, the hydrogel material itself is typically homogeneous, but the stimulus intensity varies across different regions, causing localized and time-varying deformations. These techniques, while suitable for on-demand shape reconfiguration, often require bulky external equipment, ultimately leading to challenges in mobile robot applications.\\
%applications. Hence, in these approaches, the limited design flexibility and spatiotemporal re-programmability have remained key challenges for realizing complex motion in soft robotic tasks.

Nature has adopted a hierarchical approach in addressing these challenges by using motor units as building blocks for heterogeneous muscle tissue demonstrating complex spatiotemporally reprogrammable deformations  \citesuperscript{frontera2015, drost2003}. A motor unit consists of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers innervated by its axonal terminals \citesuperscript{buchthal1980}.

More recently, voxel-based simulations have been used to predict bulk material properties of structures -- including structures made of smart hydrogels -- by controlling the material properties of individual virtual voxels \citesuperscript{Hiller2010,Oxman2011,Sossou2019}. Virtual voxels have also been utilized to simulate heterogeneous structures with robotic functions \citesuperscript{Cheney2014}.

However, physical realization of voxels as building blocks have been limited to passive and often rigid materials, and are used in conjunction with additive manufacturing processes to increase their throughput \citesuperscript{Hiller2009}. One recent work has used voxel-based computer simulations to optimize the distribution of active and passive materials in a structure for achieving different goals and the resulting mechanisms are physically realized using cardiomyocytes from a frog as building blocks for creating responsive structures\citesuperscript{Kriegman2020}.\\

Inspired by nature's approach for achieving on-demand spatiotemporal deformations in muscle tissue, we introduce addressable and tunable building blocks that can be assembled to create heterogeneous hydrogel structures with \textit{hard-coded} or \textit{reprogrammable} shape change. These building blocks, herein referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs), are shown in \firstfigref{fig:analogy}, left. The SVA units, consisting of a responsive hydrogel material and corresponding electrical connections, are inspired by the motor units of muscle tissue (\figref{fig:analogy}, right).

\end{figure}

\section{\capitalisewords{Concept}}
Two types of SVAs have been realized and are described herein: one without an embedded heater (referred to as SVA-I), and one with an embedded heater (referred to as SVA-II), as shown in \figref{fig:heterogeneous}. 
% Though voxels of different shapes can be fabricated, the voxels in this paper are fabricated in the shape of basic rectangular blocks of varying sizes to simplify manufacturing, characterization, and assembly. 
% The \subfigref{fig:1}{b} shows the schematic of SVA-II 
% % as well as its physical realization 
% in two different states as the embedded heater is turned on and off. 
Various combinations of SVA-I and SVA-II can be used for designing and fabricating heterogeneous assemblies. 
% Standard sizes allow SVA-I and SVA-II units to be assembled into heterogeneous structures for the purposes of creating complex and controllable spatiotemporal motion. 
One possible combination, shown in \subfigref{fig:heterogeneous}{(i)}, uses SVA-I to create pre-programmed voxel assemblies. Based on the specific arrangement of SVA-I consisting of different swelling properties (mainly volume change ratio and rate), complex deformations can be demonstrated. These SVA assemblies deform in response to regular and repeated homogeneous temperature changes (such as the bulk heating and cooling of a water reservoir), generating motions without the need for an on-board energy source. It should be noted that hydrogels expand and contract based on the diffusion of water into and out of their structure when the temperature is passed their critical transition temperature which is around 32\textsuperscript{o} C in case of PNIPAAm hydrogels. Therefore, all our experiments are performed in a water bath. Another combination of SVAs shown in \subfigref{fig:heterogeneous}{(ii)}, uses thick film surface mount (SMD) resistive elements with a resistance of 10 ohms as Joule heaters in SVA-II units to create time-varying and inhomogeneous temperature fields, resulting in on-demand dynamic deformations and real-time reconfigurability. Details of the Joule heater elements are presented in the \ref{chap:SVAs}.\\

The ability to select from a broad range of material properties for SVA fabrication can expand the design space of resulting heterogeneous structures. Therefore, a synthesis method that can tune the ratio and rate of hydrogel volume change is required. 
% to achieve \sout{hydrogels with} a broad spectrum of swelling properties for creating modular SVA assemblies with efficient motion and dexterity.} 
A variety of physical and chemical methods have been explored to alter the swelling properties of hydrogels \cite{Zhang2008,Imran2010}. 
These methods are limited by factors such as the narrow range of achievable swelling properties \cite{Kim2016a,Gan2001}, large trade-offs in mechanical properties \cite{Li2018,Depa2012}, long processing times \cite{Zhou2018b, Ma2014}, and a need for careful control of synthesis conditions such as temperature \cite{Otsuka2012} and precursor additives \cite{Bodenberger2016}.\\ 

We take advantage of PNIPAAm's cononsolvency, a property of reduced solvation in a mixture of two solvents due to a delicate balance between polymer-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions \cite{Pica2016}. Employing a water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent in the PNIPAAm hydrogel precursor solution, followed by rapid photopolymerization to induce interconnected open pores, significantly enhanced the rate of water transport into and out of the hydrogel matrix and thus the actuation speed. The microstructure of the gel is altered by changing the water volume fraction (\(\varphi_{w}\)) in the mixed water/DMSO solvent. The SVA swelling rate and displacement, which are directly related to its hydrogel microstructure, are therefore tuned by merely  adjusting \(\varphi_{w}\). Polymerization solvent composition is known to affect the swelling properties of the synthesized PNIPAAm hydrogels \citesuperscript{Wang2017e,Lee2000, Zhang2002,Feng2011,Tokuyama2008}. 
%Rapid actuation using hydrogels requires ultrafast swelling speeds; 
The combination of the mixed solvent method with a fast 15\,s photopolymerization step is critical for inducing and fixing local aggregations of polymer chains in place,
% \rk{aggregation of polymer chains(what does it mean)}
resulting in PNIPAAm hydrogels with open pore structures (\firstsubfigref{fig:photothermo}{A(i)}). Such open pore structures exhibit significantly enhanced rates of thermoresponsive volume change in both heating and cooling phases, compared to conventional hours-long mixed solvent thermopolymerization methods (control experiment), in which the precursors are constantly diffusing towards a homogeneous molecular equilibrium throughout the duration of the reaction, leading to a less interconnected pore structure with thicker pore walls (\subfigref{fig:photothermo}{A(ii)}).
In order to ensure a valid comparison, the recipe for a representative thermopolymerized control hydrogel was carefully tuned using the initiator concentration while leaving all other components of the precursor solution unchanged, choosing a reaction time such that the conversion and water content match those of the photopolymerized hydrogel (\ref{sec:photoThermo}). It is readily observed that with equivalent water content, reaction conversion, and reaction solvent composition, the thermopolymerized hydrogel deswells as fast as the photopolymerized hydrogel \subfigref{fig:photothermo}{B(i)} and the two reach nearly identical shrunken volumes. However the reswelling speed of the thermopolymerized control sample is $\sim$25 times slower than the photopolymerized sample, which can be attributed to the lower observable tortuosity present in the photopolymerized sample \subfigref{fig:photothermo}{B(ii)}. The Young's Modulus of the thermopolymerized hydrogel is $\sim$10 times higher than that of the photopolymerized one. \\

\end{figure}

The effect of varying \(\varphi_{w}\) on the hydrogel microstructure has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in \firstfigref{fig:sem}. Six hydrogels consisting of various \(\varphi_{w}\) were synthesized; they are each represented by a character code ranging from HG00 (representing a hydrogel with \(\varphi_{w}\) = 0.0) to HG05 (representing a hydrogel with \(\varphi_{w}\) = 0.5). Details of the SEM imaging procedure are described in \ref{chap:SVAs}. Distinct changes in the microstructure can be observed as a function of \(\varphi_{w}\), which impacts a variety of other material properties. When \(\varphi_{w}\) is increased from 0.0 to 0.2, pore size decreases and the pore wall surface begins to change from smooth to rough. We define \(\varphi_{w}\) = 0.2 as a critical water volume fraction, at which the microstructure of the gel starts to change from a closed-pore to an open-pore structure. SEM images for other values of \(\varphi_{w}\) are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:compiledSEM}.

% \rk{this section should be rewritten to account for the fact that we have characterized actuators and not the material}
The changes in hydrogel microstructure play a role in the dynamic response of SVAs. The linear displacement generated by a SVA unit
% defined as the volume of the fully swollen SVA to that of dry gel -- 
is measured using a vision-based test setup as described in Figure~\ref{fig:swellingTestSetup}. \firstsubfigref{fig:forcedisp}{A} plots the time evolution of the displacement ($D$) of SVA units with different values of $\varphi_w$ 
%as a function of time -- 
as each SVA's embedded heater is turned on for 60\,s 
% \rk{should a space be inserted between the s 60?} \xh{typically yes, between the number and unit} 
and then turned off for 60\,s. The displacement over time of the hydrogel made with \(\varphi_{w}\) = 0.0 is included as the basis for comparison across all tests. The negative displacement observed is because the SVAs initially expand instead of contract as the heater is turned on which might be due to water slightly expanding and vaporizing. Two performance criteria for the SVA units, deformation rate ($DR$) and maximum displacement ($MD$), are extracted from the data in \subfigref{fig:forcedisp}{A} and are shown in \subfigref{fig:forcedisp}{B,C} respectively. During both heating and cooling, $DR$ is small for \(\varphi_{w} < 0.2\). At \(\varphi_{w} = 0.2\), the $DR$ during heating is more than 36 times the $DR$ during cooling. As a result, fast and large deformations are observed during the 60\,s of heating, and almost no deformation is observed during the 60\,s of cooling. 
Highest $DR$ (in both heating and cooling) occurs in gels with $\varphi_w = 0.3$, while $MD$ peaks at $\varphi_w = 0.2$ and decrease thereafter.
% \note{more, or faster? rate or total shrinkage? use quantitative DR, MD etc..} 
% as the heater is turned on. When the heater is turned off, however, the gel does not swell during the 60s duration of the experiment.
In addition to swelling properties, other mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and force produced by the SVAs can also be tuned by adjusting \(\varphi_{w}\) \ref{chap:SVAs}.\\

\section{\capitalisewords{Hard-coded Shape Morphing}}
% We have used the tunable hydrogel recipe and voxel-based assembly as tools to increase the variety and complexity of shape transformations in heterogeneous structures. Due to the wide range of tunable properties enabled by our hydrogel synthesis technique,
A variety of heterogeneous structures can be produced that transform into different configurations, depending on their hard-coded material domains.
% \rk{add description about why we grouped voxels together and cast them together} 
As a first example, a beam with only two material domains is fabricated from HG00 and HG02 hydrogels (\firstsubfigref{fig:bilayer}{(i)}). 
% We use this structure as a bench mark to compare the performance of structures produced using our mixed solvent method to those presented in materials science literature\note{\citesuperscript{}}. 
At 20\,$^{\circ}$C, the beam is in its equilibrium position. As the temperature increases to 45\,$^{\circ}$C, the HG02 hydrogel shrinks more than HG00 (from \subfigref{fig:forcedisp}{B,C}, both $MD$ and $DR$ are higher for HG02), 
% \note{more or faster?} 
which results in a stress mismatch. To balance these stresses, the beam bends into a circular shape as seen in \subfigref{fig:bilayer}{(ii) ,(iii)}.
We will henceforth refer to this structure as a `gripper'. %for future reference.

\label{fig:bilayer}
\end{figure}

A second example uses HG00 and HG02 hydrogels again, but this time with 
% a voxel-based arrangement, creating shape morphing structures with multiple 
8 material domains, as shown in \firstsubfigref{fig:hardcoded}{(i-iii)}. The beams in these figures consist of different arrangements of HG00 and HG02 voxels, and as a result exhibit different deformations when subjected to a homogeneous temperature change in the surrounding water from 20\,$^{\circ}$C to 45\,$^{\circ}$C.\\

When the surrounding water bath temperature is increased, each structure reconfigures into a different shape, depending on its arrangement of SVA-I units.}
\label{fig:hardcoded}
\end{figure}

Patterning material domains can be used to leverage the shape transformations into unique functions tied to structural heterogeneity. To demonstrate this \textit{structure--function} relationship, two different structures, Str-I and Str-II, are made with different combinations of HG00, HG02, and HG03, as shown in \firstfigref{fig:hardcodedrobot}. These structures represent a combination of the structures in \figref{fig:bilayer} and \figref{fig:hardcoded}. In response to a global cyclic temperature change from 20\,$^{\circ}$C to 45\,$^{\circ}$C and back to 20\,$^{\circ}$C, these structures are observed to bend towards an object, grasp it (by wrapping around it), and transport it to another location. 
\begin{figure}[!ht]

The snapshots display the configurations of the two structures over time as the global water bath temperature is increased and then decreased.}
\label{fig:hardcodedrobot}
\end{figure}

The geometric configuration of material domains in both structures are the same. However, the `gripper' portion of Str-I is a combination of HG00/HG03 domains, whereas in Str-II it is a combination of HG00/HG02 domains. As a result of this minor material difference, the object grasped by Str-I and Str-II moves along different trajectories, as seen in \firstfigref{fig:hardcodedtraj}{A}, despite an identical set of initial conditions. Due to the high $DR$ of HG03 during the cooling phase (\subfigref{fig:forcedisp}{B}), the gripper in Str-I opens and the object is released in the early stages of the cooling phase. The gripper in Str-II, on the other hand, does not open at the same time as Str-I and continues to hold the object throughout its cooling phase; this can be attributed to the lower $DR$ of the HG02 layer compared to HG03. To illustrate these differences, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the object over time are plotted in \subfigref{fig:hardcodedtraj}{B}, and the time when the object is released by each structure is indicated. Achieving inhomogeneous deformations in response to a homogeneous global stimulus using structures with hard-coded deformations as described simplifies the system and eliminates the need for on-board power sources.\\

\section{\capitalisewords{On-demand Shape Morphing}}
For applications in dynamic, unstructured environments, such as underwater robotic exploration, it is less useful to pre-program complex trajectories into a structure, since global stimulus control is not always feasible. To enable on-demand thermoresponsive shape morphing in these conditions, SVA-II units may be employed, as depicted in \subfigref{fig:heterogeneous}{(ii)}. The 40×11×5 mm structure shown in \firstsubfigref{fig:16svaArm}{A} was assembled using 16 SVA-II units. These SVAs are made of HG03, which exhibits the highest $DR$ observed across all recipes (\subfigref{fig:forcedisp}{B}). The first example of on-demand shape morphing is illustrated in \subfigref{fig:16svaArm}{B(i)}, in which the structure morphs into an `S' shape and a `reverse S' shape when particular SVAs are actuated via commands from a microcontroller. %where the same structure morphs into `S' and `reverse S' shapes based on commands from a microcontroller. 
A second example of on-demand shape morphing is illustrated in \subfigref{fig:16svaArm}{B(ii)}; it highlights how the curvature of a structure may be varied as a function of the voltage supplied to the SVA-II units.\\

\end{figure}

Moving from static to dynamic on-demand shape changes requires time-varying activation of SVAs.
As demonstrated in \firstfigref{fig:armTrajOnOff}, the choice of SVA actuation pattern can influence the end-effector trajectory of a structure. In this experiment, SVAs 1 thorough 8 are activated according to patterns denoted by P1 and P2. Each SVA is activated with maximum voltage (3.7\,V) for 15\,s before the next SVA is activated.

While complex motion of SVA-II-based structures may be achieved using simple on (3.7\,V) and off (0\,V) activation signals, as discussed, intermediate voltages may also be applied to further enhance the complexity of shape change in soft heterogeneous structures. To demonstrate this, phase-shifted sinusoidal voltages were used as activation signals to generate longitudinal traveling waves in the structure. A pair of SVAs (comprising a SVA on the left and its adjacent SVA on the right) are activated using the same sinusoidal signal; SVAs 4 and 12 were not activated, to serve as a geometric reference point. The sinusoidal voltages applied to every SVA pair were $\frac{\pi}{8}~rad$ out of phase with the voltages applied to its nearest active SVA pair. As an example, sinusoidal signals for four SVA pairs are shown in  \firstfigref{fig:sineWaves}. A contraction wave was formed as a result of this input signal pattern and traveled along the length of the structure, as illustrated in \firstfigref{fig:4peristaltic}. Every point on the structure oscillates in a sinusoidal manner as the wave passes through it. The midpoint of the inactive SVA pair, which is highlighted by a yellow square in \figref{fig:peristaltic}, is shown as a reference point on the structure. Additionally, by sending the sinusoidal signals to SVAs located on only one side of the structure, for example SVAs 1 through 8, transverse traveling waves were generated in the structure.

The ability to control the trajectory of the structure's end-effector, as shown in \figref{fig:armTrajOnOff}, is essential to successful functioning of the device in unstructured environments, in which working conditions may change during operation. As depicted in \firstfigref{fig:unstructured}, time-sequenced switching of selected SVA-II units within the structure makes it possible to accomplish various robotic tasks such as collision avoidance (top row) and object transport (bottom row). The trajectory of the end point $p$ and the angle $\theta$ of the end plate over time ($p$ and $\theta$ are defined in \firstfigref{fig:unstructuredTraj}) during each of these two tasks is displayed  in \subfigref{fig:4}{G}. The on-demand control of reorientation and translation of the end-effector made it possible to complete these two tasks, indicating that highly redundant time-varying deformations in heterogeneous structures are achievable using individually addressable SVA-II units.

\section{\capitalisewords{Conclusions}}
To summarize, we have developed the following tools to increase the variety and complexity of shape transformations in heterogeneous hydrogel structures: a voxel-based assembly design for patterning material domains, and a unique mixed-solvent photopolymerization hydrogel synthesis method for tuning swelling properties of the voxels. These tools offer a higher number of design parameters, namely, the configuration of the voxels, the material properties of each voxel, and the activation voltage of each voxel (in the case of SVA-II). This rich set of design parameters can be specified to build structures that meet the requirements of a variety of tasks. The resulting heterogeneous structures can generate complex time-varying trajectories and traveling waves, enabling them to interact with unstructured environments in ways that could not be realized in bulk hydrogels or that would require sophisticated integration and manufacturing.\\

The simplicity of these tools advances the utility of hydrogel structures in robotics applications in a meaningful way because they can be used in robotics research laboratories that lack sophisticated material processing facilities.

While this dissertation focuses specifically on PNIPAAm hydrogel voxels, soft and rigid voxels made of other types of responsive or non-responsive materials can also be incorporated into heterogeneous assemblies. Closed-loop control of the deformation of the structures presented in this dissertation could be achieved by integrating strain- and force-sensitive voxels, made of similar functional hydrogels, that serve as sensors. In addition, multi-objective optimization across material properties and voxel configurations can be used to design structures with higher force production capacity and %higher 
energy efficiency. Currently, integrating multiple active degrees of freedom (DOFs) in miniaturized soft robots is challenging due to space limitations. Each SVA can be considered as an active DOF and we have demonstrated that the integration of a high number of SVAs in a small footprint, such as the 16-voxel structure presented in this chapter, is possible. To address the challenges of fabricating large-scale 
assemblies consisting of hundreds of voxels, % is still challenging and
automated methods must be developed for scalable manufacturing and assembly of voxels.
