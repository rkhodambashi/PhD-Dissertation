This dissertation would not be possible without the great effort from my adviser Dr. Daniel M. Aukes. He has provided constant advise and technical support and more importantly, made sure the project is properly funded and sustainable. Therefore, I would like to thank him for helping me start my Ph.D. journey. I also thank my committee members Dr. Thomas Sugar and Dr. Changho Nam for their support and valuable input which helped to improve the work in my dissertation.

My mother, Batoul Sadri, my father Dr. Mahmood Khodambashi and my siblings Kave, Nima and Mahsa deserve a lot of appreciation for all their unconditional love and support. I hope one day I can compensate my long absence and not being able to be there for them during the hard times.  

I have also enjoyed the company of friends and would like to thank them for cheering me up when I wanted to quit. JJG, you are the best and most supportive, octopus obsessed friend ever.

My lab members helped to accelerate my research and dig me out of a hole when I was dealing with hard problems. I thank all of them for their valuable discussion and feedback.
