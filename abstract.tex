Current  soft  actuators  rely  on  additional  hard-ware  such  as  pumps,  high  voltage  supplies,  light  generationsources   and   magnetic   field   generators   for   their   operation.These  components  resist  miniaturization  and  embedding  theminto  small-scale  soft  robots  would  be  challenging.  This  limitstheir  mobile  applications  where  the  entire  system  needs  tobe  untethered  especially  in  hyper-redundant  robots  where  ahigh  number  of  actuators  are  needed.  Here,  we  introduceminiature  and  untethered  robots  made  of  soft  voxel  actuators(SVAs)  â€“  an  active  voxel  using  stimuli-responsive  hydrogelsactuated  by  electrical  currents  through  Joule  heating.  SVAsweighing  only  100 mg  require  small  footprint  microcontrollersfor  their  operation  which  can  be  embedded  in  the  roboticsystem.  We  have  demonstrated  the  advantages  of  hydrogel-based  SVAs  through  a  hyper-redundant  manipulator  with  16actuators  and  an  untethered  miniature  robot  for  underwatermobile  applications.
