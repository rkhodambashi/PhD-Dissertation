abstract = {Conspectus Biological systems found in nature provide excellent stimuli-responsive functions. The camouflage adaptation of cephalopods (octopus, cuttlefish), rapid stiffness change of sea cucumbers, opening of pine cones in response to humidity, and rapid closure of Venus flytraps upon insect touch are some examples of nature's smart systems. Although current technologies are still premature to mimic these sophisticated structures and functions in smart biological systems, recent work on stimuli-responsive programmable matter has shown great progress. Stimuli-responsive materials based on hydrogels, responsive nanocomposites, hybrid structures, shape memory polymers, and liquid crystal elastomers have demonstrated excellent responsivities to various stimuli such as temperature, light, pH, and electric field. However, the technologies in these stimuli-responsive materials are still not sophisticated enough to demonstrate the ultimate attributes of an ideal programmable matter: fast and reversible reconfiguration of programmable matter into complex and robust shapes. Recently, reconfigurable (or programmable) matter that reversibly changes its structure/shape or physical/chemical properties in response to external stimuli has attracted great interest for applications in sensors, actuators, robotics, and smart systems. In particular, key attributes of programmable matter including fast and reversible reconfiguration into complex and robust 2D and 3D shapes have been demonstrated by various approaches. In this Account, we review focused areas of smart materials with special emphasis on the material and device structure designs to enhance the response time, reversibility, multistimuli responsiveness, and smart adhesion for efficient shape transformation and functional actuations. First, the capability of fast reconfiguration of 2D and 3D structures in a reversible way is a critical requirement for programmable matter. For the fast and reversible reconfiguration, various approaches based on enhanced solvent diffusion rate through the porous or structured hydrogel materials, electrostatic repulsion between cofacial electrolyte nanosheets, and photothermal actuation are discussed. Second, the ability to reconfigure programmable matters into a variety of complex structures is beneficial for the use of reconfigurable matter in diverse applications. For the reconfiguration of planar 2D structures into complex 3D structures, asymmetric and multidirectional stress should be applied. In this regard, local hinges with stimuli-responsive stiffness, multilayer laminations with different responsiveness in individual layers, and origami and kirigami assembly approaches are reviewed. Third, multistimuli responsiveness will be required for the efficient reconfiguration of complex programmable matter in response to user-defined stimulus under different chemical and physical environments. In addition, with multistimuli responsiveness, the reconfigured shape can be temporarily affixed by one signal and disassembled by another signal at a user-defined location and time. Photoactuation depending on the chirality of carbon nanotubes and composite gels with different responsiveness will be discussed. Finally, the development of smart adhesives with on-demand adhesion strength is critically required to maintain the robust reconfigurable shapes and for the switching on/off of the binding between components or with target objects. Among various connectors and adhesives, thermoresponsive nanowire connectors, octopus-inspired smart adhesives, and elastomeric tiles with soft joints are described due to their potential applications in joints of deformable 3D structures and smart gripping systems.},

abstract = {— Undulating structures are one of the most diverse and successful forms of locomotion in nature, both on ground and in water. This paper presents a comparative study for actuation by undulation in water. We focus on actuating a 1DOF systems with several mechanisms. A hydraulic pump attached to a soft body allows for water movement between two inner cavities, ultimately leading to a flexing actuation in a side-to-side manner. The effectiveness of six different, self-contained designs based on centrifugal pump, flexible impeller pump, external gear pump and rotating valves are compared. These hydraulic actuation systems combined with soft test bodies were then measured at a lower and higher oscillation frequency. The deflection characteristics of the soft body, the acoustic noise of the pump and the overall efficiency of the system are recorded. A brushless, centrifugal pump combined with a novel rotating valve performed at both test frequencies as the most efficient pump, producing sufficiently large cyclic body deflections along with the least acoustic noise among all pumps tested. An external gear pump design produced the largest body deflection, but consumes an order of magnitude more power and produced high noise levels. Further refinement remains on determining the suitable oscillation frequencies and inner cavity designs for optimal efficiency and movement.},

abstract = {One of the challenges in the emerging field of origami engineering is achieving large deformations to enable significant shape transformations. Bistable compliant mechanisms provide a means to achieve this, and the goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility and design of a compliant bistable mechanism that is actuated by magneto active elastomer material. When exposed to an external field, magneto active elastomer material deforms to align embedded magnetic particles with the field. We investigate a case study using magneto active elastomer actuation through the development of finite element analysis models to predict the magnetic field required to snap the device from its first stable position to its second for various geometries and field strengths. The finite element analysis model also predicts the displacement of the mechanism as it moves from one position to the other to determine whether the device is in fact bistable. These results can be used to understand the relationship between the substrate properties and the bistability of the device. The experimental results validate the finite element analysis models and demonstrate the functionality of active magneto active elastomer materials to be used as actuators for such devices and applications of origami engineering.

abstract = {A double-periodic array of pairs of parallel gold nanorods is shown to have a negative refractive index in the optical range. Such behavior results from the plasmon resonance in the pairs of nanorods for both the electric and the magnetic components of light. The refractive index is retrieved from direct phase and amplitude measurements for transmission and reflection, which are all in excellent agreement with simulations. Both experiments and simulations demonstrate that a negative refractive index n′≈−0.3 is achieved at the optical communication wavelength of 1.5 µm using the array of nanorods. The retrieved refractive index critically depends on the phase of the transmitted wave, which emphasizes the importance of phase measurements in finding n′.},

abstract = {Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering, vehicles for drug delivery, actuators for optics and fluidics, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels have achieved stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10 J m(-2) (ref. 8), as compared with ∼1,000 J m(-2) for cartilage and ∼10,000 J m(-2) for natural rubbers. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100-1,000 J m(-2) (refs 11, 14, 17). Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain ∼90{\%} water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of ∼9,000 J m(-2). Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.},

Chemical synthesis was employed to coat the PET fabrics by polypyrrole using ferric chloride as oxidant and antraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQSA) and naphthalene sulfonic acid (NSA) as dopants. The coated fabrics exhibited reasonable electrical stability, possessed high electrical conductivity, and were effective in heat generation. Surface resistance of polypyrrole-coated fabrics ranged from approximately 150 to 500 $\Omega$/square. Different connections between conductive fabrics and the power source were examined. When subjected to a constant voltage of 24 V, the current transmitted through the fabric decreased about 10{\%} in 72 h. An increase in resistance of conductive fabrics subjected to constant voltage was observed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

KGaA, Weinheim Hydrogel actuators that can undergo structural change upon external stimuli are highly demanded due to their potential applications in diverse fields. However, the actuators based on physically cross-linked supramolecular hydrogels are largely unexplored. This study reports the engineering of an electrically controllable supramolecular hydrogel as an actuator from a self-assembling short peptide, in which a catechol moiety is introduced as the stimuli-responsive motif. This kind of electrochemically responsive hydrogel is mechanically stable and can switch its physical properties dramatically upon the applied electric field. The mechanism and reversibility of the change are studied in detail. As a proof of principle, devices are designed to perform the unidirectional expansion and rotational motion under electrical stimulations. The applications of the actuators for controllable drug release and actuation of microfluidic devices are also illustrated. It is expected that these kind of supramolecular hydrogel actuators can find broad applications as novel biosensors, artificial robots, and smart soft materials.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing or rapid prototyping, has been introduced since the late 1980s. Although a considerable amount of progress has been made in this field, there is still a lot of research work to be done in order to overcome the various challenges remained. Recently, one of the actively researched areas lies in the additive manufacturing of smart materials and structures. Smart materials are those materials that have the ability to change their shape or properties under the influence of external stimuli. With the introduction of smart materials, the AM-fabricated components are able to alter their shape or properties over time (the 4th dimension) as a response to the applied external stimuli. Hence, this gives rise to a new term called ‘4D printing' to include the structural reconfiguration over time. In this paper, recent major progresses in 4D printing are reviewed, including 3D printing of enhanced smart nanocomposites, shape memory alloys, shape memory polymers, actuators for soft robotics, self-evolving structures, anti-counterfeiting system, active origami and controlled sequential folding, and some results from our ongoing research. In addition, some research activities on 4D bio-printing are included, followed by discussions on the challenges, applications, research directions and future trends of 4D printing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. This paper presents a 3-dimensional (3D) printed soft parallel contactless actuator for the first time. The actuator involves an electro-responsive parallel mechanism made of two segments namely active chain and passive chain both 3D printed. The active chain is attached to the ground from one end and constitutes two actuator links made of responsive hydrogel. The passive chain, on the other hand, is attached to the active chain from one end and consists of two rigid links made of polymer. The actuator links are printed using an extrusion-based 3D-Bioplotter with polyelectrolyte hydrogel as printer ink. The rigid links are also printed by a 3D fused deposition modelling (FDM) printer with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as print material. The kinematics model of the soft parallel actuator is derived via transformation matrices notations to simulate and determine the workspace of the actuator. The printed soft parallel actuator is then immersed into NaOH solution with specific voltage applied to it via two contactless electrodes. The experimental data is then collected and used to develop a parametric model to estimate the end-effector position and regulate kinematics model in response to specific input voltage over time. It is observed that the electroactive actuator demonstrates expected behaviour according to the simulation of its kinematics model. The use of 3D printing for the fabrication of parallel soft actuators opens a new chapter in manufacturing sophisticated soft actuators with high dexterity and mechanical robustness for biomedical applications such as cell manipulation and drug release.},

Recently, it has been shown that changes to the body of a robot may also scaffold the evolution of non trivial behavior. This raises the question of whether two different kinds of scaffolding (environmental and morphological) synergize with one another when combined. Here it is shown that, for legged robots evolved to perform phototaxis, synergy can be achieved, but only if morphological and environmental scaffolding are combined in a particular way: The robots must first undergo morphological scaffolding, followed by environmental scaffolding. This suggests that additional kinds of scaffolding may create additional synergies that lead to the evolution of increasingly complex robot behaviors.},

Hydrogels have been prepared from the monomer NIPAAm and suitable cross-linkers, and these hydrogels also exhibit volume phase-transition at the LCST of PNIPAAm and shrink above the LCST with the release of swelled water. 6 Many researchers have studied this phase-transition to analyze its chemical and physical properties. 7 Since the hydrogels can act as a reservoir for various functional molecules, e.g., in biomedical applications, temperature-dependent controlled release of molecules has been demonstrated. 8 In addition, the rapid swelling and deswelling of hydrogels is important for the use of actuators. 9 The deswelling rate of hydro-gels is known to be relatively slow compared to that of linear polymer. To refine the hydrogel properties, it is important to enhance and control the shrinking rate by suitable methods. The formation of a porous structure has been shown to effectively enhance the deswelling rate of PNIPAAm gels. Several reports have described the simple prepara-tion of porous hydrogels including (1) the incorporation of surfactants during hydrogel preparation and their subsequent extraction, 10 (2) hydrogel preparation above its LCST, 11 and (3) hydrogel preparation by a freeze-dry and hydration process. 12 In all cases, the deswelling rate of PNIPAAm hydrogels has been enhanced by the formation of porous structures. In the present study, porous PNIPAAm hydrogels having a rod shape were prepared by the incorporation of silica microparticles and subsequent acid treatment to remove the silica, and the thermoresponsive proper-ties of these hydrogels were analyzed. The deswelling rate was significantly enhanced compared to conven-tional hydrogels and was easily controllable by adjust-ments in the amount of silica. Using the present method, it is simple to control the thermoresponsive properties of the resulting hydrogels. These results are comparable to those of a previous study, in which porous hydrogels were prepared by the polymerization of monomer solutions incorporated into nanoporous silica particles, with a millimeter size range, and subsequent acid treatment was used to remove the silica. 13 Such porous silica-hydrogel composites have been used as a support for the controlled release of model drugs. 14 PNIPAAm hydrogels were prepared by free radical polymerization of NIPAAm (monomer) and N,N′-meth-ylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS) (cross-linker) in the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS) (initiator) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylenediamine (TEMED) (polymerization ac-celerator) for 8 h at 4 °C in a glass capillary tube with a diameter of 1 mm. For the preparation of porous hydrogels, 0-22{\%} v/v (silica/solvent) of silica particles with a polyhedral shape and a mean size of 3.3 µm was added before the polymerization, and subsequently the silica particles were dissolved in the aqueous 23 wt {\%} HF solution by immersion of the hybrid hydrogels for 24 h at ambient temperature. The resulting cylinder-shaped hydrogel was then cut into 10 mm lengths for the analysis of thermoresponsive properties. Transmis-sion Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained with a Herschel FT/IR-610 (Jasco) under a nitrogen atmosphere at ambient temperature. The hydrogels were freeze-dried and put into a KBr pellet. The interferograms were co-added 10 times and Fourier transformed at a resolution of 4 cm -1 . For scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation, the hydrogels were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then dried under a vacuum. The dried hydrogels were fixed onto a stage for SEM observation. Gold was sputtered onto the sample at a thickness of approximately 20 nm. The surface was then analyzed with a HITACHI S-4100H (Hitachi) at an accelerated voltage of 5 kV. The swelling and deswelling of the hydrogels were observed directly by a Stemi DV4 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) connected to a digital camera Cyber-shot DSC-F505V (Sony). The swelling ratios were calculated from the weight ratio between the swollen hydrogel (W s) and the dried one (W d) (W s /W d) and from the ratio between the diameter of the hydrogel at 20 °C (D 0) and the corre-sponding temperature (D): D/D 0 . To analyze the deswell-ing process quantitatively, a semilogarithmic plot as a first-ordered rate analysis was applied to the time dependence of the deswelling as follows where D ∞ is the equilibrium-swelling diameter at ad-equate temperature, k is a constant, and t is time. The greater the slope of the plot of ln{\{}(D -D ∞)/(D 0 -D ∞){\}} against t, the faster the deswelling process. The preparation conditions and the characterization of porous hydrogels are summarized in Table 1. A monomer, NIPAAm, was polymerized with a cross-linker, BIS, by free radical polymerization in the pres-ence of silica, resulting in the formation of hydrogels with yields between 79 and 82{\%}. The disappearance of a siloxane vibration band for the sequential IR analysis indicated the dissolution of the silica particles incorpo-rated into the hydrogels. The absorption bands corre-sponding amide groups (amide I and II) were also maintained and the carbonyl vibration band typically assigned to carboxyl acids was not observed. These results indicate that treatment of the hydrogels in an},

These actuators were prepared via polycondensation between four-armed poly(ethylene glycol) and a [c2]daisy chain based on $\alpha$-cyclodextrin as the host component and azobenzene as a photoresponsive guest component. The light-induced actuation arises from the sliding motion of the [c2]daisy chain unit. Ultraviolet irradiation caused the gels to bend towards the light source. The response of the [c2]AzoCD 2 xerogel, even under dry conditions, is very fast (7° every second), which is 10,800 times faster than the [c2]AzoCD 2 hydrogel (7° every 3h). In addition, the [c2]AzoCD 2 xerogel was used as a crane arm to lift an object using ultraviolet irradiation to produce mechanical work.},

abstract = {The paper presents a nonlinear Finite Element (FE) algorithm to simulate the inhomogeneous steady swelling of polymeric gels. The algorithm is developed based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic part and a swelling part. The corresponding constitutive framework and linearization of the FE equation are elaborated, which leads to an equivalent body force driving the materials to swell. A staggered iterative procedure is designed to ensure the strongly coupled chemical and mechanical fields to reach the equilibrium state simultaneously. The constitutive equations are constructed in the framework of the volumetric-isochoric splitting of the free energy function, which is helpful both for a different treatment of the incompressible part in the FE equation and for a physical interpretation of the coupling effects between the chemical and mechanical fields. In the present work, an additive free energy function, coupling the contributions of the Flory-Huggins model and the non-Gauss statistical-mechanical model, is adopted and the corresponding consistent tangent modulus in the current configuration is also derived. To implement the FE algorithm, two two-dimensional (2D) elements and one three-dimensional (3D) element are developed, which are validated by some analytical solutions, such as free swelling of gels in 2D and 3D cases, squeezing a swollen gel with uniform pressure and the constrained swelling of a single-layer and a core-shell gel ring. The algorithm is also proved to be capable of handling the surface instabilities and some engineering applications such as hydrogel-based composite beams and thin films.},

This paper demonstrates a fast manufacturing method that can produce features in biocompatible materials down to tens of micrometers in scale, with intricate and composite patterns in each layer. By exploiting the unique mechanical properties of hydrogels, we developed a "locking mechanism" for precise actuation and movement of freely moving parts, which can provide functions such as valves, manifolds, rotors, pumps, and delivery of payloads. Hydrogel components could be tuned within a wide range of mechanical and diffusive properties and can be controlled after im-plantation without a sustained power supply. In a mouse model of osteosarcoma, triggering of release of doxorubicin from the device over 10 days showed high treatment efficacy and low toxicity, at 1 / 10 of the standard systemic chemo-therapy dose. Overall, this platform, called implantable microelectromechanical systems (iMEMS), enables development of biocompatible implantable microdevices with a wide range of intricate moving components that can be wirelessly controlled on demand, in a manner that solves issues of device powering and biocompatibility.},

This model accounts for the ionic fluxes within both the hydrogel and solution, the coupling between the electric field, ionic fluxes, and mechanical deformations of the hydrogel. The main contribution of this model is to incorporate the relationship between the concentrations of the ionized fixed-charge groups and the diffusive hydrogen ion, which follows a Langmuir isotherm, into the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system. To validate this MECpH model, one-dimensional steady-state simulations under varying pH solution are carried out via a meshless Hermite-Cloud methodology, and the numerical results are compared with available experimental data.

abstract = {Despite its compactness, the human eye can easily focus on different distances by adjusting the shape of its lens with the help of ciliary muscles. In contrast, traditional man-made optical systems achieve focusing by physical displacement of the lenses used. But in recent years, advances in miniaturization technology have led to optical systems that no longer require complicated mechanical systems to tune and adjust optical performance. These systems have found wide use in photonics, displays and biomedical systems. They are either based on arrays of microlenses with fixed focal lengths, or use external control to adjust the microlens focal length. An intriguing example is the tunable liquid lens, where electrowetting or external pressure manipulates the shape of a liquid droplet and thereby adjusts its optical properties. Here we demonstrate a liquid lens system that allows for autonomous focusing. The central component is a stimuli-responsive hydrogel integrated into a microfluidic system and serving as the container for a liquid droplet, with the hydrogel simultaneously sensing the presence of stimuli and actuating adjustments to the shape--and hence focal length--of the droplet. By working at the micrometre scale where ionic diffusion and surface tension scale favourably, we can use pinned liquid-liquid interfaces to obtain stable devices and realize response times of ten to a few tens of seconds. The microlenses, which can have a focal length ranging from -infinity to +infinity (divergent and convergent), are also readily integrated into arrays that may find use in applications such as sensing, medical diagnostics and lab-on-a-chip technologies.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing or rapid prototyping, has been introduced since the late 1980s. Although a considerable amount of progress has been made in this field, there is still a lot of research work to be done in order to overcome the various challenges remained. Recently, one of the actively researched areas lies in the additive manufacturing of smart materials and structures. Smart materials are those materials that have the ability to change their shape or properties under the influence of external stimuli. With the introduction of smart materials, the AM-fabricated components are able to alter their shape or properties over time (the 4th dimension) as a response to the applied external stimuli. Hence, this gives rise to a new term called ‘4D printing' to include the structural reconfiguration over time. In this paper, recent major progresses in 4D printing are reviewed, including 3D printing of enhanced smart nanocomposites, shape memory alloys, shape memory polymers, actuators for soft robotics, self-evolving structures, anti-counterfeiting system, active origami and controlled sequential folding, and some results from our ongoing research. In addition, some research activities on 4D bio-printing are included, followed by discussions on the challenges, applications, research directions and future trends of 4D printing.},

However, the restrictive mold-casting and post-assembly fabrication alongside mechanical fragility impedes the development of hydrogel-based soft robots. Herein, we harness biocompatible alginate as a rheological modifier to manufacture 3D freeform architectures of both chemically and physically cross-linked hydrogels using the direct-ink-write (DIW) printing. The intrinsically hydrophilic polymer network of alginate allows the preservation of the targeted functions of the host hydrogels, accompanied by enhanced mechanical toughness. The integration of free structures and available functionalities from diversified hydrogel family renders an enriched design platform for bioinspired fluidic and stimulus-activated robotic prototypes from an artificial mobile tentacle, a bioengineered robotic heart with beating-transporting functions, and an artificial tendril with phototropic motion. The design strategy expands the capabilities of hydrogels in realizing geometrical versatility, mechanical tunability, and actuation complexity for biocompatible soft robots.},

abstract = {Origami is used beyond purely aesthetic pursuits to design responsive and customizable mechanical metamaterials. However, a generalized physical understanding of origami remains elusive, owing to the challenge of determining whether local kinematic constraints are globally compatible and to an incomplete understanding of how the folded sheet's material properties contribute to the overall mechanical response. Here, we show that the traditional square twist, whose crease pattern has zero degrees of freedom (DOF) and therefore should not be foldable, can nevertheless be folded by accessing bending deformations that are not explicit in the crease pattern. These hidden bending DOF are separated from the crease DOF by an energy gap that gives rise to a geometrically driven critical bifurcation between mono- and bistability. Noting its potential utility for fabricating mechanical switches, we use a temperature-responsive polymer-gel version of the square twist to demonstrate hysteretic folding dynamics at the sub-millimetre scale.},

abstract = {Actuation is an essential function of any artificial or living machine, allowing its movement and its interaction with the surrounding environment. Living muscles have evolved over millions of years within animals as nature's premier living generators of force, work and power, showing unique characteristics in comparison with standard artificial actuators. Current actuation technologies actually represent a real bottleneck in many robotics and ICT applications, including the bio-inspired ones. Main limitations involve inertia and backdrivability, stiffness control and power consumption. The development of novel actuators able to better mimic or even to overcome living muscle performances would open new horizons in robotics and ICT technologies: these components would allow the raise of a new generation of machines, with life-like movements and outstanding performances. An innovative solution to achieve this goal is represented by the merging between artificial and living entities, towards the realization of bio-hybrid devices. The aim of the present article is to describe the scientific and technological efforts made by researchers in the last two decades to achieve cell- or tissue-based actuators, with the dream of matching or outperforming natural muscles and to efficiently power micro- and mini-devices. The main challenges connected to the development of a cell-based actuator are highlighted and the most recent solutions to this scientific/technological problem are depicted, reporting advantages and drawbacks of each single approach. Future perspectives are also described, envisioning bio-hybrid actuators as key components of a new generation of machines able to show life-like movements and behaviors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim Hydrogel actuators represent a powerful tool due to their ability to capture, move, and be manipulated, which has applications in diverse fields. The development of hydrogel actuators capable of localized movement, where only a part of the whole system moves, wireless remote control, and flexible shape-changing is critical and challenging to fulfill their potential. Here, photothermal hydrogel actuators are designed and fabricated to accomplish a precise hand-like manipulation of encapsulating and finger-like one-by-one bending by light. A thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) active layer and a non-thermoresponsive poly(acrylamide) passive layer are combined to generate a thermal-expansion coefficient mismatch among the interface and this energy eventually transforms into a bending motion. As an energy transformation agent, the gold nanoparticles doped in the PNIPAm hydrogel absorb the light energy and transform it into thermalenergy effectively as a result of a surface plasmon resonance electron–phonon process and intrinsic interband transitions. The resulting nanocomposite actuators exhibit flexible, reversible motions and local hand-like finger flexion driven by either flood illumination or local irradiation. The developed programmable actuators are expected to be an attractive candidate for the next generation of “smart” soft robots.},

abstract = {— Soft robotics carries with the promise of making robots as capable and adaptable as biological creatures, but this will not be possible without the ability to perform self-sensing and control with precision and repeatability. In this paper, we seek to address this need with the development of a new pneumatically-actuated soft bending actuation module with integrated curvature sensing. We designed and fabricated two different versions of this module: one with a commercially available resistive flex sensor and the other with a magnetic curvature sensor of our own design, and used an external motion capture system to calibrate and verify the validity of these two modules. In addition, we used an iterative sliding mode controller to drive the modules through step curvature references to demonstrate the controllability of the modules as well as compare the usability of the two sensors. We found that the magnetic sensor returned noisy but accurate data, while the flex sensor was inaccurate and subject to drift but did not exhibit notable noise. Experimental results show that this phenomenon of drift from the flex sensor causes active feedback control of the bending actuator to exhibit significant positioning errors. This work demonstrates that our soft bending actuator can be controlled with repeatability and precision, and that our magnetic curvature sensor represents an improvement for use in closed-loop control of soft robotic devices.},

First, we discuss the use and control of biomolecules as nanoscale actuators. Molecular motors, such as DNA, kinesin, myosin, and F1-ATPase, have been shown to exert forces in the range between 1 pN to 45 pN. Second, we discuss the use and control of single and small clusters of cells to power microscale devices. Microorganisms, such as flagellated bacteria, protozoa, and algae, can naturally swim at speeds between 20 $\mu$m s(-1) to 2 mm s(-1) and produce thrust forces between 0.3 pN to 200 pN. Individual and clustered mammalian cells, such as cardiac and skeletal cells, can produce even higher contractile forces between 80 nN to 3.5 $\mu$N. Finally, we discuss the use and control of 2D- and 3D-assembled muscle tissues and muscle tissue explants as bioactuators to power devices. Depending on the size, composition, and organization of these hierarchical tissue constructs, contractile forces have been demonstrated to produce between 25 $\mu$N to 1.18 mN.},

Based on a multi-joint robotic fish model, two basic Carangiform swimming patterns, namely "cruise" and "C sharp turning", are extracted as training samples from the observations of real fish swimming. A General Internal Model (GIM), which is an imitation of Central Pattern Generator (CPG) in nerve systems, is adopted to learn and to regenerate coordinated fish behaviors. By virtue of the universal function approximation ability and the temporal/spatial scalabilities of GIM, the proposed learning approach is able to generate the same or similar fish swimming patterns by tuning two parameters. The learned swimming patterns are implemented on a multi-joint robotic fish in experiments. The experiment results verify the effectiveness of the biomimetic learning approach in generating and modifying locomotion patterns for the robotic fish. {\textcopyright}2013 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Here we present a new 4D printing technique capable of producing a diverse range of trilayer constructs using commercial low-cost desktop 3D printers. This unique methodology permits the viable construction of dynamically robust and complex origami architectures for a new generation of active structures. The resulting creations transform from flat 2D parts to 3D structures through submersion in water and return to their original configuration through dehydration. This technique uses commercially available materials and printers to enable a 4D printing method that is more accessible and affordable than previous examples of hydration triggered 4D printing. This method yields a controlled and predictable actuation route and final shape, enabling it to be used for both simple and complex origami inspired designs, such as the tessellated waterbomb origami pattern, a design that has not previously been realised with 4D printing. These new designs demonstrate how the integration of multiple trilayers into a single 3D print enables through-thickness control of actuation and resulting formation of active structures with complexity beyond what has previously been achieved with 4D printing.},

abstract = {Below relevant defect densities, many materials at the microstructural level have properties 10–100 times better than their bulk counterparts. Parameters such as strength, piezoelectricity, fatigue strength, and many others exhibit this behavior. Outside the microworld, however, efforts to exploit these properties directly have been stymied by the challenges of identifying defect-free particles and then combining them in sufficient numbers to be useful. Recently, progress has been made in microrobotics that may change the practicality of addressing these large-number problems. Multiple systems of more than 1000 small robots have been demonstrated, and processes for testing, microassembly, and joining have been developed. This chapter discusses challenges and opportunities in the exciting new field of microrobotic additive manufacturing. In addition to building below defect densities, we also discuss closely related heterogeneous microassembly, potentially enabling complex systems, including other robots, to be built with optimized geometric and material performance.},

abstract = {The dynamics of unconstrained mechanical systems is governed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). When kinematic constraints need to be accounted for, Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) arise. This work describes the introduction of kinematic constraints, expressed as algebraic relationships between the coordinates of unconstrained mechanical systems, ensuring compliance of the solution with up to the second-order derivative of holonomic constraint equations within the desired accuracy, without altering the ODE structure of the unconstrained problem. This represents a simple, little-intrusive, yet effective means to enforce kinematic constraints into existing formulations and implementations originally intended to address ODE problems, without the complexity of solving DAEs or resorting to implicit numerical integration schemes, and without altering the number and type of equations of the original unconstrained problem. The proposed formulation is compared to known approaches. Numerical applications of increasing complexity illustrate its distinguishing aspects. ? 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

This aim is explored and evaluated through an experimental design investigation in the form of an architectural skin. Through experimentation with alternative materials and a rigorous process of designing the responsive material systems, a new architectural skin, namely Blanket, emerged from this research. The newly developed responsive material system is an amalgamation of silicone rubbers and glowing pigments, molded and fabricated in a prescribed way—embedded with shape memory alloys on a tensegrity skeletal structure to achieve the desired morphing properties and absorb solar energy to glow in the dark. Thus, the design investigation explores the potential of the use of form-changing materials with capacitance sensing, energy absorbing and illumination capabilities for a morphing architectural skin that is capable of responding to proximity and lighting stimuli. This lightweight, flexible and elastic architectural morphing skin is designed to minimize the use of discrete mechanical components. It moves towards an integrated “synthetic” morphing architecture that can sense and respond to environmental and occupancy conditions.},

abstract = {Soft robotic snakes promise significant advantages in achieving traveling curvature waves with a reduced number of active segments as well as allowing for safe and adaptive interaction with the environment and human users. However, current soft robot platforms suffer from a lack of accurate theoretical dynamic models and proprioceptive measurements, which impede advancements toward full autonomy. To address this gap, this paper details our recent results on the design, fabrication, and experimental evaluation of a new-generation pressure-operated soft robotic snake platform we call the WPI SRS, which employs custom magnetic sensors embedded in a flexible backbone to continuously monitor the curvature of each of its four bidirectional bending segments. In addition, we present a complete and accurate dynamic undulatory locomotion model that accounts for the propagation of frictional moments to describe linear and rotational motions of the SRS. Experimental studies indicate that on-board sensory measurements provide accurate real-time curvature feedback, and numerical simulations offer a level of abstraction for lateral undulation under ideal conditions. {\&}copy; 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrogels are fascinating and useful in that they can show large volume changes in response to various stimuli, such as temperature or chemical environment. Here we report the peculiar observation that chemically crosslinked hydrogels that normally expand owing to a change in electrolyte pH can be made to shrink in certain circumstances. Specifically, these hydrogels contract when tested at a constant compressive force and subjected to a pH change that causes expansion in the absence of the applied load. When tested under tension, the gels always expand. Although the effects of external stress on the swelling of gels is known, the concomitant change in gel mechanical properties during pH switching was found to be a more dominant effect in our studies. However, existing mechanical models used to predict dimensional changes in actuator materials could not explain both the tensile and compression results. In addition, we show that the friction between metal plates of the apparatus and the gel is a key factor in explaining the contractile actuation under compressive loads. The observations reported in this paper are important for the successful design and use of hydrogel actuators in devices such as valves for microfluidics.},

abstract = {3D printed active composites (PACs) are a new concept in active composite design and manufacturing where one or several active materials are used as fiber materials to create active shape changing composites that are determined by the design of fibers. Recent advances in multi-material 3D printing have enabled the rapid realization of these designs, many of which would not be possible without 3D printing. In addition, the integration of active materials with 3D printing also permits the novel concept of 4D printing, where the shape of an object can change after 3D printing. In the past, using printed active composites to create origami structures was demonstrated but was limited to simple folding patterns. In this paper, we study the relationship among folding angle, fiber orientation, and applied load during programming, in order to find the optimized fiber arrangement and loading directions for complicated folding patterns. Both experiments and finite element1 simulations were performed to optimize the fiber orientations in PAC in order to achieve the desired shape change, and good agreement was achieved. FEA was then used to help the design for some complicated, self-folding, active origami structures-including a miura-ori pattern, a table, a sailboat and a crane—in which the folding occurs in different directions. The successful implementation of these complicated patterns demonstrates the capability of using printed active composites for very complicated self-folding origami designs. {\textcopyright} 2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

The results of research were used in the design of a propulsion system modelled simultaneously on two methods of movement in the aquatic environment.

Artificial muscle fibers are composed of artificial sarcomeres arranged in series. The structure of artificial sarcomeres is designed and optimized. The simulation indicates that the linear electromagnetic series-parallel array artificial muscle possesses some good characteristics, such as high response speed, small volume, light quality, high power density ect.. The linear electromagnetic series-parallel array artificial muscle has good prospects for actual engineering application.},

abstract = {In both biological and engineered systems, functioning at peak power output for prolonged periods of time requires thermoregulation. Here, we report a soft hydrogel-based actuator that can maintain stable body temperatures via autonomic perspiration. Using multimaterial stereolithography, we three-dimensionally print finger-like fluidic elastomer actuators having a poly- N -isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAm) body capped with a microporous ({\~{}}200 micrometers) polyacrylamide (PAAm) dorsal layer. The chemomechanical response of these hydrogel materials is such that, at low temperatures ({\textless}30°C), the pores are sufficiently closed to allow for pressurization and actuation, whereas at elevated temperatures ({\textgreater}30°C), the pores dilate to enable localized perspiration in the hydraulic actuator. Such sweating actuators exhibit a 600{\%} enhancement in cooling rate (i.e., 39.1°C minute −1 ) over similar non-sweating devices. Combining multiple finger actuators into a single device yields soft robotic grippers capable of both mechanically and thermally manipulating various heated objects. The measured thermoregulatory performance of these sweating actuators ({\~{}}107 watts kilogram −1 ) greatly exceeds the evaporative cooling capacity found in the best animal systems ({\~{}}35 watts kilogram −1 ) at the cost of a temporary decrease in actuation efficiency.},

abstract = {Human fingers and hands are frequently injured because they are delicate, complex, and used constantly. More than 3 million people in the United States suffer from hand or forearm disabilities [1], and, worldwide, hand injuries account for one-third of all work injuries [2]. Due to the importance of hands and the prevalence of hand issues, there is an increasing effort toward developing hand orthotics. These efforts have resulted in active hand orthoses that have been used for rehabilitation training and restoring partial hand function [3]. To ensure safety and to reduce control complexity, some orthoses use mechanical compliances [4], [5] such as underactuated linkages [6] or low-stiffness materials and structures (e.g., rubbers and flexible wires) [7], [8]-[11]. The orthoses made of elastomeric materials tend to be more comfortable, perhaps because their low elastic modulus (10 kPa {\textless}; G' {\textless}; 1 MPa) [12] is similar to that of human skin ({\~{}}100 kPa) [13].},

The focus of the analysis is the problem of object acquisition. In comparison to many prior grasp analysis tools, the tool presented here models the dynamics of a hand, including actuation mechanisms, compliance and friction in an efficient formulation that permits one to evaluate variations in such quantities as phalange length, finger spacing, transmission ratios, and torsional joint stiffness when comparing hand designs. The analysis is demonstrated for a quasi-static object acquisition problem and leads to the computation of a vector space of three dimensional regions for which the hand will tend to center and stably grasp a compact object.},

abstract = {Humans possess manual dexterity, motor skills, and other physical abilities that rely on feedback provided by the somatosensory system. Herein, a method is reported for creating soft somatosensitive actuators (SSAs) via embedded 3D printing, which are innervated with multiple conductive features that simultaneously enable haptic, proprioceptive, and thermoceptive sensing. This novel manufacturing approach enables the seamless integration of multiple ionically conductive and fluidic features within elastomeric matrices to produce SSAs with the desired bioinspired sensing and actuation capabilities. Each printed sensor is composed of an ionically conductive gel that exhibits both long-term stability and hysteresis-free performance. As an exemplar, multiple SSAs are combined into a soft robotic gripper that provides proprioceptive and haptic feedback via embedded curvature, inflation, and contact sensors, including deep and fine touch contact sensors. The multimaterial manufacturing platform enables complex sensing motifs to be easily integrated into soft actuating systems, which is a necessary step toward closed-loop feedback control of soft robots, machines, and haptic devices.
Soft somatosensitive actuators are created by embedded 3D printing of ionically conductive and fluidic features within molded elastomeric matrices. Specifically, these actuators are innervated with sensors that bestow soft robotic grippers with proprioceptive, haptic, and thermoceptive sensing capabilities akin to our own bodies'. This approach represents a foundational advance with potential applications in soft robotic, wearable, and haptic devices.},

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics is a promising approach to overcom- ing the limitations and biases of human designers in pro- ducing control strategies for autonomous robots. However, most work in evolutionary robotics remains solely concerned with optimizing control strategies for existing morphologies. By contrast, natural evolution, the only process that has pro- duced intelligent agents to date, may modify both the control (brain) and morphology (body) of organisms. Therefore, co- evolving morphology along with control may provide a better path towards realizing intelligent robots. This paper presents a novel method for co-evolving morphology and control us- ing CPPN-NEAT. This method is capable of dynamically ad- justing the resolution at which components of the robot are created: a large number of small sized components may be present in some body locations while a smaller number of larger sized components is present in other locations. Ad- vantages of this capability are demonstrated on a simple task, and implications for using this methodology to create more complex robots are discussed},

abstract = {The crosslinking polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) was investigated at a monomer concentration of 5 w/v{\%} in water with N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BAAm) as the crosslinker. The crosslinker ratio (mole ratio of BAAm to AAm) was set to 1/82. The fractional monomer conversion x, the weight fraction of gel Wg, and the equilibrium weight swelling ratio qw of the hydrogels were measured as a function of the reaction time. Experimental results indicate that the first gel molecule in the reaction system appears after a reaction time tc = 4 ± 1 min or after a monomer conversion of xc = 0.07 ± 0.02. At this critical point the homogeneous reaction system turned into a heterogeneous one consisting of gel and separated solution phases. The network formation process took place in this heterogeneous system within the first 60 min of the reaction time. Experimental x, Wg, and qw data indicate that, during the gel growth process, the growing hydrogel molecule cannot occupy the entire polymerization system, which is responsible for the observed phase separation. It was shown that the volume of the separated liquid phase decreases as the polymerization and crosslinking reactions proceed and finally, the reaction system becomes homogeneous again due to the decreasing dilution degree of the hydrogel.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim. To create life-like movements, living muscle actuator technologies have borrowed inspiration from biomimetic concepts in developing bioinspired robots. Here, the development of a bioinspired soft robotics system, with integrated self-actuating cardiac muscles on a hierarchically structured scaffold with flexible gold microelectrodes is reported. Inspired by the movement of living organisms, a batoid-fish-shaped substrate is designed and reported, which is composed of two micropatterned hydrogel layers. The first layer is a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel substrate, which provides a mechanically stable structure for the robot, followed by a layer of gelatin methacryloyl embedded with carbon nanotubes, which serves as a cell culture substrate, to create the actuation component for the soft body robot. In addition, flexible Au microelectrodes are embedded into the biomimetic scaffold, which not only enhance the mechanical integrity of the device, but also increase its electrical conductivity. After culturing and maturation of cardiomyocytes on the biomimetic scaffold, they show excellent myofiber organization and provide self-actuating motions aligned with the direction of the contractile force of the cells. The Au microelectrodes placed below the cell layer further provide localized electrical stimulation and control of the beating behavior of the bioinspired soft robot.},

abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are found in mobile robots, assistive wearable devices, and rehabilitative technologies. While soft actuators have been one of the most crucial elements of technology leading the development of the soft robotics field, they fall short of force output and bandwidth requirements for many tasks. In addition, other general problems remain open, including robustness, controllability, and repeatability. The SPA-pack architecture presented here aims to satisfy these standards of reliability crucial to the field of soft robotics, while also improving the basic performance capabilities of SPAs by borrowing advantages leveraged ubiquitously in biology; namely, the structured parallel arrangement of lower power actuators to form the basis of a larger and more powerful actuator module. An SPA-pack module consisting of a number of smaller SPAs will be studied using an analytical model and physical prototype. Experimental measurements show an SPA pack to generate over 112 N linear force, while the model indicates the benefit of parallel actuator grouping over a geometrically equivalent single SPA scale as an increasing function of the number of individual actuators in the group. For a module of four actuators, a 23{\%} increase in force production over a volumetrically equivalent single SPA is predicted and validated, while further gains appear possible up to 50{\%}. These findings affirm the advantage of utilizing a fascicle structure for high-performance soft robotic applications over existing monolithic SPA designs. An example of high-performance soft robotic platform will be presented to demonstrate the capability of SPA-pack modules in a complete and functional system.},

Here we report on the bottom-up design of macroscopic tubes that exhibit anisotropic actuation driven by a thermal stimulus. The tube is built from a hydrogel in which extremely long supramolecular nanofibers are aligned using weak shear forces, followed by radial growth of thermoresponsive polymers from their surfaces. The hierarchically ordered tube exhibits reversible anisotropic actuation with changes in temperature, with much greater contraction perpendicular to the direction of nanofiber alignment. We identify two critical factors for the anisotropic actuation, macroscopic alignment of the supramolecular scaffold and its covalent bonding to polymer chains. Using finite element analysis and molecular calculations, we conclude polymer chain confinement and mechanical reinforcement by rigid supramolecular nanofibers are responsible for the anisotropic actuation. The work reported suggests strategies to create soft active matter with molecularly encoded capacity to perform complex tasks.},

The main advantage of the model is its ability to solve inhomogeneous deformations due to a sta-ble behavior in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature. Therefore, inhomogeneous swelling of a spherical shell on a hard core with application to microfluidics is analytically and numerically investigated for various thicknesses of the shell. Based on the solved examples, it is shown that the model possesses continuity and stability in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature.},

Simultaneously depositing photopolymers and a non-curing liquid allows complex, pre-filled fluidic channels to be fabricated. This new printing capability enables complex hydraulically actuated robots and robotic components to be automatically built, with no assembly required. The technique is showcased by printing linear bellows actuators, gear pumps, soft grippers and a hexapod robot, using a commercially-available 3D printer. We detail the steps required to modify the printer and describe the design constraints imposed by this new fabrication approach.},

abstract = {We designed a robotic fish caudal fin with six individually moveable fin rays based on the tail of the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus. Previous fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency; thrust was maximized by the 500× stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by the 1000× stiffness fin rays.},

In particular, sampling the complex, nonlinear dynamics associated with submesoscales ({\textless}1-10 km) requires new technologies and approaches. Here we introduce the Mini-Autonomous Underwater Explorer (M-AUE), deployed as a swarm of 16 independent vehicles whose 3D trajectories are measured near-continuously, underwater. As the vehicles drift with the ambient flow or execute preprogrammed vertical behaviours, the simultaneous measurements at multiple, known locations resolve the details of the flow within the swarm. We describe the design, construction, control and underwater navigation of the M-AUE. A field programme in the coastal ocean using a swarm of these robots programmed with a depth-holding behaviour provides a unique test of a physical-biological interaction leading to plankton patch formation in internal waves. The performance of the M-AUE vehicles illustrates their novel capability for measuring submesoscale dynamics.},

Recently, a series of newly developed soft materials—gallium-based liquid metals (LMs) are found to display dramatical roles in making soft machines and robotics with their unusual properties in soft robotic actuation and self-driven field. With superior merits of both high stretchability and electroconductivity over conventional soft materials, LM is increasingly innovated as flexible sensors and actuators in constructing intelligent soft robots. Typical advances in LM enabled soft machines and robotics are summarized and interpreted, herein, with special focus on the driving principles of the LM objects, the preparation methods of LM flexible electronics for making soft robots, and the applications of LM in biomedicines and intelligent robots, together with the consideration of key challenges facing LM-based soft robotics and its future prospects.},

abstract = {The process by which spatial variations in growth transform two-dimensional elastic membranes into three-dimensional shapes is both a fundamentally interesting mechanism of shape selection and a powerful tool for the preparation of responsive materials. From the perspective of lithographic patterning of thin gel sheets, it is most straightforward to prepare materials consisting of discrete regions with different degrees of swelling. However, the sharp variations in swelling at the boundaries between such regions make it impossible for the sheet to adopt a configuration that is free of in-plane stresses everywhere. Thus, the deformation of such materials is not well understood. Here, we consider the geometrically simple case of a photo-crosslinkable poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) copolymer patterned into thin rectangular strips divided into one high- and one low-swelling region. When swelled in an aqueous medium at 22°C, the sheet rolls into a three-dimensional shape consisting of two nearly cylindrical regions connected by a transitional neck. Heating to 50°C leads to fully reversible de-swelling back to a flat configuration. We propose a scaling argument based on a balance between stretching and bending energies that relates the curvature of the 3D shape to the width and thickness of the strip, find good agreement with experimental data and numerical simulations, and further demonstrate how this simple geometry provides a powerful route for the fabrication of self-folding stimuli-responsive micro-devices. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The development of fully soft robots, especially fully from smart soft materials to mimic soft animals, is still nascent. In addition, to date, existing soft robots cannot adapt themselves to the surrounding environment, i.e., sensing and adaptive motion or response, like animals. Here, compliant ultrathin sensing and actuating electronics innervated fully soft robots that can sense the environment and perform soft bodied crawling adaptively, mimicking an inchworm, are reported. The soft robots are constructed with actuators of open-mesh shaped ultrathin deformable heaters, sensors of single-crystal Si optoelectronic photodetectors, and thermally responsive artificial muscle of carbon-black-doped liquid-crystal elastomer (LCE-CB) nanocomposite. The results demonstrate that adaptive crawling locomotion can be realized through the conjugation of sensing and actuation, where the sensors sense the environment and actuators respond correspondingly to control the locomotion autonomously through regulating the deformation of LCE-CB bimorphs and the locomotion of the robots. The strategy of innervating soft sensing and actuating electronics with artificial muscles paves the way for the development of smart autonomous soft robots.},

However so little is made to let designers explore the so uncovered design space. Compared to DFAM, what could be called Design for 4D printing (DF4DP)does lag far behind. In this article, a modeling framework for simulating SMs and conventional materials behaviors on a voxel basis is proposed; this allows for arranging materials in any distribution and rapidly evaluating the behavior of the distribution. Homogeneous and heterogeneous objects made of conventional materials and SMs were modeled and simulated. The modeled SMs were limited to non-programmable shape changing SMs including: piezoelectric material, electro-/magneto-/photostrictive materials and hydrogel. A printed smart valve and a theoretical actuator (both from other publications)were used as test cases. These simulations have a speed reasonable for the design iterations needed in conceptual design phase and they yield results in good agreement with physics.},

This is demonstrated using a soft silicone arm through a technique of multiplexing, which enables the rich transient dynamics of the soft materials to be fully exploited as a computational resource. The computational performance of the soft silicone arm is examined through two standard benchmark tasks. Results show that the soft arm compares well to or even outperforms conventional machine learning techniques under multiple conditions. We then demonstrate that this system can be used for the sensory time series prediction problem for the soft arm itself, which suggests its immediate applicability to a real-world machine learning problem.

This mechanism is relatively easy to miniaturize and the hopping performance improves in a smaller scale. Two prototypes are developed based on electromagnetic simulation and an analytic model of hopping process. The first prototype has a dimension of {\$}\Phi{\$}30 mm × 10 mm and a mass of 41.59 g, with a hopping height of about 45 mm. The second one has a dimension of {\$}\Phi{\$}14 mm × 6 mm and a mass of 4.94 g, and achieves a hopping height of about 65 mm.},

abstract = {Below relevant defect densities, many materials at the microstructural level have properties 10–100 times better than their bulk counterparts. Parameters such as strength, piezoelectricity, fatigue strength, and many others exhibit this behavior. Outside the microworld, however, efforts to exploit these properties directly have been stymied by the challenges of identifying defect-free particles and then combining them in sufficient numbers to be useful. Recently, progress has been made in microrobotics that may change the practicality of addressing these large-number problems. Multiple systems of more than 1000 small robots have been demonstrated, and processes for testing, microassembly, and joining have been developed. This chapter discusses challenges and opportunities in the exciting new field of microrobotic additive manufacturing. In addition to building below defect densities, we also discuss closely related heterogeneous microassembly, potentially enabling complex systems, including other robots, to be built with optimized geometric and material performance.},

We present the governing equations and equilibrium conditions of an isothermal process based on the monophase gel field theory of hydrogel via a variational approach. We have adopted and implemented an explicit form of energy for temperature-sensitive hydrogel in a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) using a user-supply subroutine in ABAQUS. For verification purpose, a few numerical results obtained by the proposed approach are compared with existing experimental data and analytical solutions. They are all in good agreement.

abstract = {The sarcomere of muscle is composed of tens of thousands of myosin motors that self-assemble into thick filaments and interact with surrounding actin-based thin filaments in a dense, near-crystalline hexagonal lattice. Together, these actin-myosin interactions enable large-scale movement and force generation, two primary attributes of muscle. Research on isolated fibres has provided considerable insight into the collective properties of muscle, but how actin-myosin interactions are coordinated in an ensemble remains poorly understood. Here, we show that artificial myosin filaments, engineered using a DNA nanotube scaffold, provide precise control over motor number, type and spacing. Using both dimeric myosin V- and myosin VI-labelled nanotubes, we find that neither myosin density nor spacing has a significant effect on the gliding speed of actin filaments. This observation supports a simple model of myosin ensembles as energy reservoirs that buffer individual stochastic events to bring about smooth, continuous motion. Furthermore, gliding speed increases with cross-bridge compliance, but is limited by Brownian effects. As a first step to reconstituting muscle motility, we demonstrate human $\beta$-cardiac myosin-driven gliding of actin filaments on DNA nanotubes.},

abstract = {Shape-morphing systems, which can perform complex tasks through morphological transformations, are of great interest for future applications in minimally invasive medicine1,2, soft robotics3–6, active metamaterials7 and smart surfaces8. With current fabrication methods, shape-morphing configurations have been embedded into structural design by, for example, spatial distribution of heterogeneous materials9–14, which cannot be altered once fabricated. The systems are therefore restricted to a single type of transformation that is predetermined by their geometry. Here we develop a strategy to encode multiple shape-morphing instructions into a micromachine by programming the magnetic configurations of arrays of single-domain nanomagnets on connected panels. This programming is achieved by applying a specific sequence of magnetic fields to nanomagnets with suitably tailored switching fields, and results in specific shape transformations of the customized micromachines under an applied magnetic field. Using this concept, we have built an assembly of modular units that can be programmed to morph into letters of the alphabet, and we have constructed a microscale ‘bird' capable of complex behaviours, including ‘flapping', ‘hovering', ‘turning' and ‘side-slipping'. This establishes a route for the creation of future intelligent microsystems that are reconfigurable and reprogrammable in situ, and that can therefore adapt to complex situations.},

abstract = {Continuum robot manipulators present challenges for controller design due to the complexity of their infinite-dimensional dynamics. This paper develops a practical dynamics-based approach to synthesizing state feedback controllers for a soft continuum robot arm composed of segments with local sensing, actuation, and control capabilities. Each segment communicates its states to its two adjacent neighboring segments, requiring a tridiagonal feedback matrix for decentralized controller implementation. A semi-discrete numerical approximation of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation is used to represent the robot arm dynamics. Formulated in state space representation, this numerical approximation is used to define an H-{\{}$\backslash$infty{\}} optimal control problem in terms of a Bilinear Matrix Inequality. We develop three iterative algorithms that solve this problem by computing the tridiagonal feedback matrix which minimizes the H-{\{}$\backslash$infty{\}} norm of the map from disturbances to regulated outputs. We confirm through simulations that all three controllers successfully dampen the free vibrations of a cantilever beam that are induced by an initial sinusoidal displacement, and we compare the controllers' performance.},

abstract = {Electroactive hydrogels that exhibit large deformation in response to an electric field have received significant attention as a potential actuating material for soft actuators and artificial muscle. However, their mechanical actuation has been limited in simple bending or folding due to uniform electric field modulation. To implement complex movements, a pre-program, such as a hinge and a multilayer pattern, is usually required for the actuator in advance. Here, we propose a reprogrammable actuating method and sophisticated manipulation by using multipolar three-dimensional electric field modulation without pre-program. Through the multipolar spatial electric field modulator, which controls the polarity/intensity of the electric field in three-dimensions, complex three-dimensional (3D) actuation of single hydrogels are achieved. Also, air bubbles generated during operation in the conventional horizontal configuration are not an issue in the proposed new vertical configuration. We demonstrate soft robotic actuators, including basic bending mechanics in terms of controllability and reliability, and several 3D shapes having positive and negative curvature can easily be achieved in a single sheet, paving the way for continuously reconfigurable materials.},

While most current reconfigurable designs are application specific, here we present a mechanical metamaterial with tunable shape, volume and stiffness. Our approach exploits a simple modular origami-like design consisting of rigid faces and hinges, which are connected to form a periodic structure consisting of extruded cubes. We show both analytically and experimentally that the transformable metamaterial has three degrees of freedom, which can be actively deformed into numerous specific shapes through embedded actuation. The proposed metamaterial can be used to realize transformable structures with arbitrary architectures, highlighting a robust strategy for the design of reconfigurable devices over a wide range of length scales.},

abstract = {Stimuli responsive polyelectrolyte hydrogels may be useful for soft robotics because of their ability to transform chemical energy into mechanical motion without the use of external mechanical input. Composed of soft and biocompatible materials, gel robots can easily bend and fold, interface and manipulate biological components and transport cargo in aqueous solutions. Electrical fields in aqueous solutions offer repeatable and controllable stimuli, which induce actuation by the re-distribution of ions in the system. Electrical fields applied to polyelectrolyte-doped gels submerged in ionic solution distribute the mobile ions asymmetrically to create osmotic pressure differences that swell and deform the gels. The sign of the fixed charges on the polyelectrolyte network determines the direction of bending, which we harness to control the motion of the gel legs in opposing directions as a response to electrical fields. We present and analyze a walking gel actuator comprised of cationic and anionic gel legs made of copolymer networks of acrylamide (AAm)/sodium acrylate (NaAc) and acrylamide/quaternized dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA Q), respectively. The anionic and cationic legs were attached by electric field-promoted polyion complexation. We characterize the electro-actuated response of the sodium acrylate hydrogel as a function of charge density and external salt concentration. We demonstrate that "osmotically passive" fixed charges play an important role in controlling the bending magnitude of the gel networks. The gel walkers achieve unidirectional motion on flat elastomer substrates and exemplify a simple way to move and manipulate soft matter devices and robots in aqueous solutions. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all of the unknown components of the system; these are the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as the drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory-optimization techniques we find locally-optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92{\%} of the time. Last, we introduce the idea of static bracing for a soft elastomer arm and discuss how forming environmental braces might be an effective manipulation strategy for this class of robots.

abstract = {A series of temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) hydrogels with large pore size and fast response were prepared by carrying out polymerizations in aqueous sodium chloride solutions with different concentrations. In comparison with conventional PNIPA hydrogels, the PNIPA gels thus prepared have remarkably larger swelling ratios below their lower critical solution temperature (LCST), and exhibit much faster response rates as the temperature is raised above their LCST. The improved properties are due to the presence of inorganic salt, NaCl, which leads the phase separation and formation of a heterogeneous porous structure during the polymerizations. The study on the drug release properties shows the macroporous hydrogels exhibit modulated release in response to temperature. The model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), can be released completely from the porous hydrogels at the temperature lower than the LCST because the pore size of the hydrogels is larger than the protein molecules. However, the release of BSA from the gels almost stops after a "burst" release in the initial stage at the temperature higher than the LCST because the pores are closed at the high temperature.},

abstract = {The work described in this paper is a novel design of a robotic Venus flytrap (VFT) (Dionaea muscipula Ellis) by means of ionic polymeric metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscles as distributed nanosensors and nanoactuators. Rapid muscular movements in carnivorous plants, such as VFT, which are triggered by antenna-like sensors (trigger hair), present a golden key to study distributed biomolecular motors. Carnivorous plants, such as VFT, possess built-in intelligence (trigger hairs), as a strategy to capture prey, that can be turned on in a controlled manner. In the case of the VFT, the prey that is lured by the sweet nectar in the VFT pair of jaw-like lobes has to flip and move the trigger hairs, which are colorless, bristle-like and pointed. The dynamically moved trigger hairs then electro-elastically send an electric signal to the internal ions in the lobe to migrate outwardly for the jaw-like lobes to close rapidly to capture the prey. The manner in which the VFT lobes bend inward to capture the prey shows a remarkable similarity with typical IPMCs bending in an electric field. Furthermore, the mechano-electrical sensing characteristics of IPMCs also show a remarkable resemblance to mechano-electrical trigger hairs on the lobes of the VFT. The reader is referred to a number of papers in connection with sensing and actuation of IPMCs in particular. Thus, one can integrate IPMC lobes with a common electrode in the middle of one end of the lobes to act like a spine and use IPMC bristles as trigger finger to sense the intrusion of a fly or insect to send a sensing signal to a solid state relay which then triggers the actuation circuit of the IPMC lobes to rapidly bend toward each other and close. The two lobes, which form the trap, are attached to the midrib common electrode which is conveniently termed the spine. The upper surface of each lobe is dished, and spaced along the free margins of the lobes with some 15-20 prong-like teeth. These are tough and pointed, and are inclined at an inward angle so that when the trap is sprung shut they will interlock. We have been experimenting with the VFT closing of its jaw-like lobes that close in about 0.3 s and have gained a lot of knowledge to report on the ionic and electrical mechanisms involved in the operation of such intelligent distributed biomolecular motors. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Transforming flat sheets into three-dimensional structures has emerged as an exciting manufacturing paradigm on a broad range of length scales. Among other advantages, this technique permits the use of functionality-inducing planar processes on flat starting materials, which after shape-shifting, result in a unique combination of macro-scale geometry and surface topography. Fabricating arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries requires the ability to change the intrinsic curvature of initially flat structures, while simultaneously limiting material distortion to not disturb the surface features. The centuries-old art forms of origami and kirigami could offer elegant solutions, involving only folding and cutting to transform flat papers into complex geometries. Although such techniques are limited by an inherent developability constraint, the rational design of the crease and cut patterns enables the shape-shifting of (nearly) inextensible sheets into geometries with apparent intrinsic curvature. Here, we review recent origami and kirigami techniques that can be used for this purpose, discuss their underlying mechanisms, and create physical models to demonstrate and compare their feasibility. Moreover, we highlight practical aspects that are relevant in the development of advanced materials with these techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook on future applications that could benefit from origami and kirigami to create intrinsically curved surfaces.},

NC gels with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-clay (PNIPA-clay) network structures exhibit high mechanical toughnesses and reversible swelling/deswelling behavior in the absence/presence of NaCl. NC gels constrained to constant lengths in brine generate enhanced contractive forces due to the salt-induced coil-to-globule transitions that are more than ten times larger than those induced thermally. A retractive tensile force (4 N/170 kPa), comparable to that of human muscle, was repeatedly generated at 20 °C using an appropriately composed NC gel (clay: 2 mol{\%}, PNIPA: 2 M), and by alternating the NaCl concentration between 0 and 5 M. This phenomenon is attributed to the combined effects of enhanced deswelling behavior resulting from the salt-induced coil-to-globule transition of PNIPA and the high stiffness of the deswollen gel due to the NaCl-strengthened PNIPA-clay network.},

abstract = {Recent research using 3D printing to create active structures has added an exciting new dimension to 3D printing technology. After being printed, these active, often composite, materials can change their shape over time; this has been termed as 4D printing. In this paper, we demonstrate the design and manufacture of active composites that can take multiple shapes, depending on the environmental temperature. This is achieved by 3D printing layered composite structures with multiple families of shape memory polymer (SMP) fibers - digital SMPs - with different glass transition temperatures (Tg) to control the transformation of the structure. After a simple single-step thermomechanical programming process, the fiber families can be sequentially activated to bend when the temperature is increased. By tuning the volume fraction of the fibers, bending deformation can be controlled. We develop a theoretical model to predict the deformation behavior for better understanding the phenomena and aiding the design. We also design and print several flat 2D structures that can be programmed to fold and open themselves when subjected to heat. With the advantages of an easy fabrication process and the controllable multi-shape memory effect, the printed SMP composites have a great potential in 4D printing applications.},

We design single-layer hydrogel sheets with chemically distinct, fibre-like regions that exhibit differential shrinkage and elastic moduli under the application of external stimulus. Using a planar-to-helical three-dimensional shape transformation as an example, we explore the relation between the internal architecture of the sheets and their transition to cylindrical and conical helices with specific structural characteristics. The ability to engineer multiple three-dimensional shape transformations determined by small-scale patterns in a hydrogel sheet represents a promising step in the development of programmable soft matter. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Recently, the analysis of laminate micro-devices has focused more manufacturability concerns and not on mechanics. Considering the nature of such devices, we draw from existing research in composites, origami kinematics, and finite element methods in order to identify issues related to sequential assembly and self-folding prior to fabrication as well as the stiffness of composite folded systems during operation. These techniques can be useful for understanding how such devices will bend and ex under normal operating conditions, and when added to new design tools like popupCAD, will give designers another means to develop better devices throughout the design process.},

abstract = {Origami engineering aims to combine origami principles with advanced materials to yield active origami shapes, which fold and unfold in response to external stimuli. This paper explores the potential and limitations of dielectric elastomers (DEs) as the enabling material in active origami engineering. DEs are compliant materials in which the coupled electro-mechanical actuation takes advantage of their low modulus and high breakdown strength. Until recently, prestraining of relatively thick DE materials was necessary in order to achieve the high electric fields needed to trigger electrostatic actuation without inducing a dielectric breakdown. Although prestrain improves the breakdown strength of the DE films and reduces the voltage required for actuation, the need for a solid frame to retain the prestrain state is a limitation for the practical implementation of DEs, especially for active origami structures. However, the recent availability of thinner DE materials (50 mu m, 130 mu m, 260 mu m) has made DEs a likely medium for active origami. In this work, the folding and unfolding of DE multilayered structures, along with the realization of origami-inspired 3D shapes, are explored. In addition, an exhaustive study on the fundamentals of DE actuation is done by directly investigating the thickness actuation mechanism and comparing their performance using different electrode types. Finally, changes in dielectric permittivity as a function of strain, electrode type and applied electric field are assessed and analyzed. These fundamental studies are key to obtaining more dramatic folding and to realizing active origami structures using DE materials.},

We believe that soft hands are able to provide diverse and robust grasping with low control complexity. They possess many mechanical degrees of freedom and are able to implement complex deformations. At the same time, due to the inherent compliance of soft materials, only very few of these mechani-cal degrees have to be controlled explicitly. Soft hands therefore may combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we present RBO Hand 2, a highly compliant, underactuated, robust, and dexterous anthropomorphic hand. The hand is inex-pensive to manufacture and the morphology can easily be adapted to specific applications. To enable efficient hand design, we derive and evaluate computational models for the mechanical properties of the hand's basic building blocks, called PneuFlex actuators. The versatility of RBO Hand 2 is evaluated by implementing the comprehensive Feix taxonomy of human grasps. The manipulator's capabilities and limits are demonstrated using the Kapandji test and grasping experi-ments with a variety of objects of varying weight. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effective dimensionality of grasp postures exceeds the dimensionality of the actuation signals, illustrating that complex grasping behavior can be achieved with relatively simple control.},

However, shape morphing with dielectric elastomers has not been possible since no generalizable method for changing their Gaussian curvature has been devised. Here it is shown that this fundamental limitation can be lifted by introducing internal, spatially varying electric fields through a layer-by-layer fabrication method incorporating shaped, carbon-nanotubes-based electrodes between thin elastomer sheets. To illustrate the potential of the method, voltage-tunable negative and positive Gaussian curvatures shapes are produced. Furthermore, by applying voltages to different sets of internal electrodes, the shapes can be re-configured. All the shape changes are reversible when the voltage is removed.},

The hydrogels showed a significant dependence of their microstructure and other properties with the solvent used during the synthesis. Hydrogels synthesized in water showed a poor incorporation of methyl methacrylate (MMA) units as evidenced by FTIR, while those synthesized in aqueous ethanol 80 vol{\%} exhibited a higher incorporation of MMA as compared to the hydrogels obtained in aqueous dioxane 50 vol{\%}. Although the incorporation of MMA is higher for the hydrogels synthesized in aqueous ethanol 80 vol{\%}, these hydrogels displayed the highest swelling values (e.g., 6500{\%} for the polyacrylamide hydrogel). These values are approximately 7-times higher than the swelling of equivalent hydrogels synthesized in water (900{\%}).

The autonomous motion is produced by dissipating the chemical energy of an oscillating reaction occurring inside the gel. Even though the gel is completely composed of synthetic polymer, it shows an autonomous motion as if it were "alive". By coupling this with a ratchet mechanism, the gel walks by repeatedly bending and stretching itself like a looper (see figure).},

In the conventional deflection method , a piezoresistive pressure sensor is used as a chemical - mechanical - electronic transducer to measure the volume change of a pH - sensitive hydrogel . In this compensation method , the pH - sensitive hydrogel keeps its volume constant during the whole measuring process , independent of applied pH value . In order to maintain a balanced state , an additional thermal actuator is integrated into the close - loop sensor system with higher precision and faster dynamic response . Poly (N - isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) with 5 mol{\%} monomer 3 - acrylamido propionic acid (AAmPA) is used as the temperature - sensitive hydrogel , while poly (vinyl alcohol) with poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) serves as the pH - sensitive hydrogel . A thermal simulation is introduced to assess the temperature distribution of the whole microsystem , especially the temperature influence on both hydrogels . Following tests are detailed to verify the working functions of a sensor based on pH - sensitive hydrogel and an actuator based on temperature - sensitive hydrogel . A miniaturized prototype is assembled and investigated in deionized water : the response time amounts to about 25 min , just half of that one of a sensor based on the conventional deflection method . The results confirm the applicability of the compensation method to the hydrogel - based sensors .},

While the hand is designed to grasp a range of objects, the addition of light suction flow to the fingertips is especially effective for small, low-friction (slippery) objects.

The hydrogels are made of a polyether-based polyurethane and poly(acrylic acid). A simple method was employed to create hydrogels with thicknesses in the range of 20-570 $\mu$m. The hydrogel films volume changed by a factor of ∼2 when the pH was switched around the transition point (pH 4). Tensile extensibilities of up to ∼350{\%} were maintained at each pH, and the average Young's modulus and tensile strength were in the range of 580-910 and 715-1320 kPa, respectively, depending on the pH. Repeated tensile loading and unloading to 100{\%} extension showed little permanent damage, unlike analogous double-network hydrogels, and with immediate recovery (up to 75-85{\%} of the first loading cycle), unlike hybrid ionic-covalent interpenetrating network hydrogels.},

Here we present a theory for the simplest such structure: an annular circular strip that is folded along a central circular curve to form a three-dimensional buckled structure driven by geometrical frustration. We quantify this shape in terms of the radius of the circle, the dihedral angle of the fold and the mechanical properties of the sheet of paper and the fold itself. When the sheet is isometrically deformed everywhere except along the fold itself, stiff folds result in creases with constant curvature and oscillatory torsion. However, relatively softer folds inherit the broken symmetry of the buckled shape with oscillatory curvature and torsion. Our asymptotic analysis of the isometrically deformed state is corroborated by numerical simulations which allow us to generalize our analysis to study multiply folded structures.},

Some of nature's protein motors, such as myosin in muscle tissue, consist of a hierarchical supramolecular assembly of very large proteins, in which mechanical stress induces a coordinated movement. However, artificial molecular muscles have often relied on covalent polymer-based actuators. Here, we describe the macroscopic contractile muscle-like motion of a supramolecular system (comprising 95{\%} water) formed by the hierarchical self-assembly of a photoresponsive amphiphilic molecular motor. The molecular motor first assembles into nanofibres, which further assemble into aligned bundles that make up centimetre-long strings. Irradiation induces rotary motion of the molecular motors, and propagation and accumulation of this motion lead to contraction of the fibres towards the light source. This system supports large-amplitude motion, fast response, precise control over shape, as well as weight-lifting experiments in water and air.},

This paper presents a robust fault-tolerant control scheme that is designed to meet the control challenges that are encountered by such robots, i.e., discrete actuator inputs, complex system modeling, and cross-coupling between actuators. In the proposed scheme, a desired vectorial system output, such as a position or a force, is commanded by recruiting actuators based on their influence vectors on the output. No analytical model of the system is needed; influence vectors are identified experimentally by sequentially activating each actuator. For position control tasks, the controller uses a probabilistic approach and a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal combination of actuators to recruit. For motion control tasks, the controller uses a sliding mode approach and independent recruiting decision for each actuator. Experimental results on a four degrees of freedom binary manipulator with 20 actuators confirm the method's effectiveness and its ability to tolerate massive perturbations and numerous actuator failures.},

To understand the deformation of a single arm segment, we develop and experimentally validate a static deformation model. Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot's spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator's configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

abstract = {The work described in this paper is a novel design of a robotic Venus flytrap (VFT) (Dionaea muscipula Ellis) by means of ionic polymeric metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscles as distributed nanosensors and nanoactuators. Rapid muscular movements in carnivorous plants, such as VFT, which are triggered by antenna-like sensors (trigger hair), present a golden key to study distributed biomolecular motors. Carnivorous plants, such as VFT, possess built-in intelligence (trigger hairs), as a strategy to capture prey, that can be turned on in a controlled manner. In the case of the VFT, the prey that is lured by the sweet nectar in the VFT pair of jaw-like lobes has to flip and move the trigger hairs, which are colorless, bristle-like and pointed. The dynamically moved trigger hairs then electro-elastically send an electric signal to the internal ions in the lobe to migrate outwardly for the jaw-like lobes to close rapidly to capture the prey. The manner in which the VFT lobes bend inward to capture the prey shows a remarkable similarity with typical IPMCs bending in an electric field. Furthermore, the mechano-electrical sensing characteristics of IPMCs also show a remarkable resemblance to mechano-electrical trigger hairs on the lobes of the VFT. The reader is referred to a number of papers in connection with sensing and actuation of IPMCs in particular. Thus, one can integrate IPMC lobes with a common electrode in the middle of one end of the lobes to act like a spine and use IPMC bristles as trigger finger to sense the intrusion of a fly or insect to send a sensing signal to a solid state relay which then triggers the actuation circuit of the IPMC lobes to rapidly bend toward each other and close. The two lobes, which form the trap, are attached to the midrib common electrode which is conveniently termed the spine. The upper surface of each lobe is dished, and spaced along the free margins of the lobes with some 15-20 prong-like teeth. These are tough and pointed, and are inclined at an inward angle so that when the trap is sprung shut they will interlock. We have been experimenting with the VFT closing of its jaw-like lobes that close in about 0.3 s and have gained a lot of knowledge to report on the ionic and electrical mechanisms involved in the operation of such intelligent distributed biomolecular motors. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Soft robotics offers the unique promise of creating inherently safe and adaptive systems. These systems bring man-made machines closer to the natural capabilities of biological systems. An important requirement to enable self-contained soft mobile robots is an on-board power source. In this paper, we present an approach to create a bio-inspired soft robotic snake that can undulate in a similar way to its biological counterpart using pressure for actuation power, without human intervention. With this approach, we develop an autonomous soft snake robot with on-board actuation, power, computation and control capabilities. The robot consists of four bidirectional fluidic elastomer actuators in series to create a traveling curvature wave from head to tail along its body. Passive wheels between segments generate the necessary frictional anisotropy for forward locomotion. It takes 14 h to build the soft robotic snake, which can attain an average locomotion speed of 19 mm s(-1).},

abstract = {Although broadly admired for its aesthetic qualities, the art of origami is now being recognized also as a framework for mechanical metamaterial design. Working with the Miura-ori tessellation, we find that each unit cell of this crease pattern is mechanically bistable, and by switching between states, the compressive modulus of the overall structure can be rationally and reversibly tuned. By virtue of their interactions, these mechanically stable lattice defects also lead to emergent crystallographic structures such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries. Each of these structures comes from an arrangement of reversible folds, highlighting a connection between mechanical metamaterials and programmable matter. Given origami's scale-free geometric character, this framework for metamaterial design can be directly transferred to milli-, micro-, and nanometer-size systems.},

We describe a class of soft actuators, termed hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, which harness a mechanism that couples electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve a variety of actuation modes. We introduce prototypical designs of HASEL actuators and demonstrate their robust, muscle-like performance as well as their ability to repeatedly self-heal after dielectric breakdown-all using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques.

From as early as the 1940s, this has included efforts to engineer actuators and electronics out of elastomers, textiles, and other soft materials in order to mimic the compliance and deformability of natural biological tissue. In the decades since, there is extraordinary progress in the subdomain of soft robotics, with recent efforts focused on novel methods of actuation, sensing, and manufacturing. In this progress report, recent advancements within this field from the perspective of materials and mechanics are highlighted. Wherever possible, efforts in soft robotics are connected to progress in the broader field of soft-matter engineering, which relates to the application of principles and practices in the soft-matter sciences to create machines, electronics, and robotic systems out of fluids, elastomers, gels, and other soft materials. To close, the current challenges and future opportunities within the field of robotics are briefly discussed, with special attention toward the eventual goal of autonomous soft robots that are capable of operating without dependency on external hardware, tethers, or manual intervention.},

@article{Terryn2015,
abstract = {Inspired by the intrinsic softness and the corresponding embodied intelligence principles, soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) have been developed, which ensure safe interaction in unstructured, unknown environments. Due to their intrinsic softness, these actuators have the ability to resist large mechanical impacts. However, the soft materials used in these structures are in general susceptible to damage caused by sharp objects found in the unstructured environments. This paper proposes to integrate a self-healing (SH-) mechanism in SPAs, such that cuts, tears and perforations in the actuator can be self-healed. Diels-Alder (DA-) polymers, covalent polymer network systems based on the thermoreversible DA-reaction, were selected and their mechanical, as well as SH-properties, are described. To evaluate the feasibility of developing an SPA constructed out of SH-material, a single cell prototype, a SH-soft pneumatic cell (SH-SPC), was constructed entirely out of DA-polymers. Exploiting the SH-property of the DA-polymers, a completely new shaping process is presented in this paper, referred to as 'shaping through folding and self-healing'. 3D polygon structures, like the cubic SH-SPC, can be constructed by folding SH-polymer sheet. The sides of the structures can be sealed and made airtight using a SH-procedure at relatively low temperatures ({\textless}90 °C). Both the (thermo) mechanical and SH-properties of the SH-SPC prototype were experimentally validated and showed excellent performances. Macroscopic incisions in the prototype were completely healed using a SH-procedure ({\textless}70 °C). Starting from this single-cell prototype, it is straight-forward to develop a multi-cell prototype, the first SPA ever built completely out of SH-polymers.},

More than 3 million people in the United States suffer from hand or forearm disabilities [1], and, worldwide, hand injuries account for one-third of all work injuries [2]. Due to the importance of hands and the prevalence of hand issues, there is an increasing effort toward developing hand orthotics. These efforts have resulted in active hand orthoses that have been used for rehabilitation training and restoring partial hand function [3]. To ensure safety and to reduce control complexity, some orthoses use mechanical compliances [4], [5] such as underactuated linkages [6] or low-stiffness materials and structures (e.g., rubbers and flexible wires) [7], [8]-[11]. The orthoses made of elastomeric materials tend to be more comfortable, perhaps because their low elastic modulus (10 kPa {\textless}; G' {\textless}; 1 MPa) [12] is similar to that of human skin ({\~{}}100 kPa) [13].},

The design of the robot legs is inspired by the leg configuration of insects, two joints (hip and knee) of the leg enable two basic motions, lifting and stepping. The robot frame is designed to have a slope relative to the horizontal plane, which makes the robot move forward. In addition, the bounding locomotion of quadruped animals is implemented in the robot. Experiments show that the robot can carry an additional load of about 100 g and run with a fairly high velocity. The quadruped prototype can be an important step towards the goal of building an autonomous mobile robot actuated by piezocomposite actuators. ?? 2007 Jilin University.},

By defining the optimal stiffness of the NFT in simulation, a fish robot prototype is then designed and fabricated. A series of experiments are performed to verify the proposed model. Experiment results are in good agreement with simulation data. The results show that the thrust and swimming speed of the fish robot are proportional to the amplitude of the driving moment. There are two resonant frequencies (f = 1.4 Hz and 2.2 Hz), the maximum thrust and swimming speed (about 0.7 BL{\textperiodcentered}s-1) are found to be around f = 1.4 Hz.

Several model based and model free control approaches have been devel-oped for this technology, e.g. Cartesian stiffness control, optimal control, reactions, reflexes, and cyclic motion control. 20.1 Introduction Robots interacting with humans in direct physical contact or even acting in place of a human in given situations are of high interest for current research. Manipulat-ing objects in direct contact with the human or in unstructured environment likely results in contacts and collisions that are unpredictable. Furthermore, the desired robot skills include fine manipulation as well as highly dynamic and powerful movements.

abstract = {A novel technique to prepare a fast response poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) gel is proposed by using water/acetone as a mixed solvent during the polymerization/crosslinking reaction. Gels produced in this way can absorb a large amount of water at room temperature and exhibit rapid response rate as the external temperature gets changed. We suggest that, during the polymerization in the mixed solvent, the polymer chains get widely expanded, which leads to an expanded structure and a large swelling ratio (SR) of the gel in water at room temperature. From the standpoint of entropy, the expanded structure may decrease the total entropy of gel system (including the polymer chains and water molecules around them) at the swollen state, which makes this gel system yearn to collapse and undergo phase separation as the temperature gets increased. On the other hand, due to the macroporous matrix of the expanded gel, the water can diffuse out/in easily and quickly during the shrinking/reswelling process as the temperature cycles around the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Muscular‐hydrostats, muscular organs which lack typical systems of skeletal support, include the tongues of mammals and lizards, the arms and tentacles of cephalopod molluscs and the trunks of elephants. In this paper the means by which such organs produce elongation, shortening, bending and torsion are discussed. The most important biomechanical feature of muscular‐hydrostats is that their volume is constant, so that any decrease in one dimension will cause a compensatory increase in at least one other dimension. Elongation of a muscular‐hydrostat is produced by contraction of transverse, circular or radial muscles which decrease the cross‐section. Shortening is produced by contraction of longitudinal muscles. The relation between length and width of a constant volume structure allows amplification of muscle force or displacement in muscular‐hydrostats and other hydrostatic systems. Bending requires simultaneous contraction of longitudinal and antagonistic circular, transverse or radial muscles. In bending, one muscle mass acts as an effector of movement while the alternate muscle mass provides support for that movement. Torsion is produced by contraction of muscles which wrap the muscular‐hydrostat in a helical fashion. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Developing soft actuators and sensors by means of 3D printing has become an exciting research area. Compared to conventional methods, 3D printing enables rapid prototyping, custom design, and single-step fabrication of actuators and sensors that have complex structure and high resolution. While 3D printed sensors have been widely reviewed in the literature, 3D printed actuators, on the other hand, have not been adequately reviewed thus far. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing 3D printed actuators. First, the common processes used in 3D printing of actuators are reviewed. Next, the existing mechanisms used for stimulating the printed actuators are described. In addition, the materials used to print the actuators are compared. Then, the applications of the printed actuators including soft-manipulation of tissues and organs in biomedicine and fragile agricultural products, regenerative design, smart valves, microfluidic systems, electromechanical switches, smart textiles, and minimally invasive surgical instruments are explained. After that, the reviewed 3D printed actuators are discussed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages considering power density, elasticity, strain, stress, operation voltage, weight, size, response time, controllability, and biocompatibility. Finally, the future directions of 3D printed actuators are discussed.},

abstract = {In the field of soft robotics there is a need for robust and reliable large-deformation strain sensing. Further, the field needs a way to produce such sensors in large quantities and at low cost. Toward these goals, the fabrication of highly stretchable capacitive strain sensors made from conductive elastomer composites is described here. Two novel methods of manufacturing these sensors directly onto a fabric substrate are developed: direct writing of elastomer using an extrusion process and screen printing of elastomer patterns. The effect of material processing parameters on the parameters of the finished composite films is studied and it is determined that the process is robust to a wide range of variations. The performance of sensors produced on fabric substrates is shown to be similar between the two fabrication processes. Further, the sensors are highly deformable with consistent performance up to 250{\%} strain, and are reliable, with no changes in performance observed at 1000 cycles. It is also demonstrated that the sensors continue to perform with reduced gauge factors up to 100 000 cycles. For comparison, free-standing capacitive sensors are also produced with the same materials and it is shown that these devices are equally stable and robust. In conclusion, the fabrication process demonstrated here is robust to process variations and is capable of producing sensors directly on fabric substrates, which facilitates the production of large arrays of sensors without the need for an additional assembly step.},

abstract = {Research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles. The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

Major challenges towards practically viable actuators are the achievement of large electromechanical deformation, fast switching response, low operating voltage and durable operation. Here we report a new electroactive actuator composed of self-assembled sulphonated block copolymers and ionic liquids. The new actuator demonstrated improvements in actuation properties over other polymer actuators reported earlier, large generated strain (up to 4{\%}) without any signs of back relaxation. In particular, the millimetre-scale displacements obtained for the actuators, with rapid response ({\textless}1 s) at sub-1-V conditions over 13,500 cycles in air, have not been previously reported in the literature. The key to success stems from the evolution of the unique hexagonal structure of the polymer layer with domain size gradients beneath the cathode during actuation, which promotes the bending motion of the actuators. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Although fabrication and potential use of such bacteriabots have attracted much attention, existing methods of fabrication require an extensive sample preparation that can drastically decrease the viability and motility of bacteria. Moreover, chemotactic behavior of bacteriabots in a liquid medium with chemical gradients has remained largely unclear. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed Escherichia coli to autonomously display biotin on its cell surface via the engineered autotransporter antigen 43 and thus to bind streptavidin-coated cargo. We show that the cargo attachment to these bacteria is greatly enhanced by motility and occurs predominantly at the cell poles, which is greatly beneficial for the fabrication of motile bacteriabots. We further performed a systemic study to understand and optimize the ability of these bacteriabots to follow chemical gradients. We demonstrate that the chemotaxis of bacteriabots is primarily limited by the cargo-dependent reduction of swimming speed and show that the fabrication of bacteriabots using elongated E. coli cells can be used to overcome this limitation.},

A soft actuation mechanism was developed in this work, taking inspiration from the arm of the Octopus vulgaris, specifically from the muscular hydrostat which represents its constitutive muscular structure. On the basis of the authors' previous works on shape memory alloy (SMA) springs used as soft actuators, a specific arrangement of such SMA springs is presented, which is combined with a flexible braided sleeve featuring a conical shape and a motor-driven cable. This robot arm is able to perform tasks in water such as grasping, multi-bending gestures, shortening and elongation along its longitudinal axis. The whole structure of the arm is described in detail and experimental results on workspace, bending and grasping capabilities and generated forces are presented. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that it is possible to realize a self-contained octopus-like robotic arm with no rigid parts, highly adaptable and suitable to be mounted on underwater vehicles. Its softness allows interaction with all types of objects with very low risks of damage and limited safety issues, while at the same time producing relatively high forces when necessary.},

Specifically, these hydrogels contract when tested at a constant compressive force and subjected to a pH change that causes expansion in the absence of the applied load. When tested under tension, the gels always expand. Although the effects of external stress on theswellingofgelsisknown2-4, the concomitant change in gel mechanical properties during pH switching was found to be a more dominant effect in our studies. However, existing mechanical models5, 6 used to predict dimensional changes in actuator materials could not explain both the tensile and compression results. In addition, we show that the friction between metal plates of the apparatus and the gel is a key factor in explaining the contractile actuation under compressive loads.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Birds morph their wings during a single wingbeat, across flight speeds and among flight modes. Such morphing may allow them to maximize aerodynamic performance, but this assumption remains largely untested. We tested the aerodynamic performance of swept and extended wing postures of 13 raptor species in three families (Accipitridae, Falconidae and Strigidae) using a propeller model to emulate mid-downstroke of flapping during take-off and a wind tunnel to emulate gliding. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that (1) during flapping, wing posture would not affect maximum ratios of vertical and horizontal force coefficients (CV:CH), and that (2) extended wings would have higher maximum CV:CH when gliding. Contrary to each hypothesis, during flapping, extended wings had, on average, 31{\%} higher maximum CV:CHratios and 23{\%} higher CV than swept wings across all biologically relevant attack angles ($\alpha$), and, during gliding, maximum CV:CH ratios were similar for the two postures. Swept wings had 11{\%} higher CV than extended wings in gliding flight, suggesting flow conditions around these flexed raptor wings may be different from those in previous studies of swifts (Apodidae). Phylogenetic affiliation was a poor predictor of wing performance, due in part to high intrafamilial variation. Mass was only significantly correlated with extended wing performance during gliding. We conclude that wing shape has a greater effect on force per unit wing area during flapping at low advance ratio, such as takeoff, than during gliding.},

In this paper, we present a new kind of microscale soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) made from streamlined and standardized fabrication procedure with customizable bending modalities inspired by shape engineering. Preliminary mathematical models are given to interpret width-based shape engineering for customization and to compare the bending angle and radius of curvature measured from the characterization experiments. The fabricated SPA was tested on the sciatic nerve of a rat in order to show its future potentials in biomedical field. Ultimately, this paper will contribute to the diversification of SPA fabrication and customization, as well as biomedical applications that demand smaller dimensions and higher precision.},

abstract = {Orientation estimation using low cost sensors is an important task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in order to obtain a good feedback for the attitude controller. The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the ``tilt'' quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.},

@article{Shiva2016,
abstract = {— There is an emerging trend towards soft robotics due to its extended manipulation capabilities compared to traditionally rigid robot links, showing promise for an extended applicability to new areas. However, as a result of the in-herent property of soft robotics being less rigid, the ability to control/obtain higher overall stiffness when required is yet to be further explored. In this paper, an innovative design is introduced which allows varying the stiffness of a continuum silicon-based manipulator and proves to have potential for applications in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Inspired by mus-cular structures occurring in animals such as the octopus, we propose a hybrid and inherently antagonstic actuation scheme. In particular, the octopus makes use of this principle activating two sets of muscles -longitudinal and transverse muscles -thus, being capable of controlling the stiffness of parts of its arm in an antagonistic fashion. Our designed manipulator is pneumatically actuated employing chambers embedded within the robot's silicone structure. Tendons incorporated in the structure complement the pneumatic actuation placed inside the manipulator's wall to allow variation of overall stiffness. Experiments are carried out by applying an external force in different configurations while changing the stiffness by means of the two actuation mechanisms. Our test results show that dual, antagonistic actuation increases the load bearing capabilities for soft continuum manipulators and thus their range of applications.},

These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices.},

Nature has solved this problem using molecular motors that, through living cells, are assembled into multiscale ensembles with integrated control systems. These systems can scale force production from piconewtons up to kilonewtons. By leveraging the performance of living cells and tissues and directly interfacing them with artificial components, it should be possible to exploit the intricacy and metabolic efficiency of biological actuation within artificial machines.

The objective of this research is to develop a voxel-based simulator for multi-axis CNC machining. The simulator displays the machining process in which the initial workpiece is incrementally converted into the finished part. The voxel representation is used to model efficiently the state of the in-process workpiece, which is generated by successively subtracting tool swept volumes from the workpiece. The voxel representation also simplifies the computation of regularised Boolean set operations and of material removal volumes. By using the material removal rate measured by the number of removed voxels, the feedrate can be adjusted adaptively to increase the machining productivity.},

This equation is a fourth-order in space and second-order in time Partial Differential Equation (PDE) of the lateral movement function. The coefficients of this PDE were not constants because of the non-uniform beams, so they were approximated by exponential functions in order to obtain an analytical solution.

abstract = {Transforming flat sheets into three-dimensional structures has emerged as an exciting manufacturing paradigm on a broad range of length scales. Among other advantages, this technique permits the use of functionality-inducing planar processes on flat starting materials, which after shape-shifting, result in a unique combination of macro-scale geometry and surface topography. Fabricating arbitrarily complex three-dimensional geometries requires the ability to change the intrinsic curvature of initially flat structures, while simultaneously limiting material distortion to not disturb the surface features. The centuries-old art forms of origami and kirigami could offer elegant solutions, involving only folding and cutting to transform flat papers into complex geometries. Although such techniques are limited by an inherent developability constraint, the rational design of the crease and cut patterns enables the shape-shifting of (nearly) inextensible sheets into geometries with apparent intrinsic curvature. Here, we review recent origami and kirigami techniques that can be used for this purpose, discuss their underlying mechanisms, and create physical models to demonstrate and compare their feasibility. Moreover, we highlight practical aspects that are relevant in the development of advanced materials with these techniques. Finally, we provide an outlook on future applications that could benefit from origami and kirigami to create intrinsically curved surfaces.},

abstract = {Herein we discuss the folding of highly compliant origami structures – " Soft Origami. " There are benefits to be had in folding compliant sheets (which cannot self-guide their motion) rather than conventional rigid origami. Example applications include scaffolds for artificial tissue generation and foldable substrates for flexible electronic assemblies. Highly compliant origami has not been contemplated by existing theory, which treats origami structures largely as rigid or semi-rigid mechanisms with compliant hinges – " Mechanism-Reliant Origami. " We present a quantitative metric – the Origami Compliance Metric – that aids in identifying proper modeling of a homogeneous origami structure based upon the compliance regime it falls into (Soft, Hybrid, or Mechanism-Reliant). We discuss the unique properties, applications, and design drivers for practical implementation of Soft Origami. We detail a theory of proper constraint by which an ideal soft structure's number of degrees-of-freedom may be approximated as 3n, where n is the number of vertices of the fold pattern. Buckling and sagging behaviors in very compliant structures can be counteracted with the application of tension; we present a method for calculating the tension force required to reduce sagging error below a user-prescribed value. Finally, we introduce a concept for a scalable process in which a few actuators and stretching membranes may be used to simultaneously fold many origami sub-structures that share common degrees-of-freedom.},

Despite the widespread use of fluidic actuation, there have been few soft counterparts of pumps or compressors, limiting the portability and autonomy of soft machines4,8. Here we describe a class of soft-matter bidirectional pumps based on charge-injection electrohydrodynamics19. These solid-state pumps are flexible, stretchable, modular, scalable, quiet and rapid. By integrating the pump into a glove, we demonstrate wearable active thermal management. Embedding the pump in an inflatable structure produces a self-contained fluidic ‘muscle'. The stretchable pumps have potential uses in wearable laboratory-on-a-chip and microfluidic sensors, thermally active clothing and autonomous soft robots.},

abstract = {It was established at SoCG'99 that every polyhedral complex can be folded from a sufficiently large square of paper, but the known algorithms are extremely impractical, wasting most of the material and making folds through many layers of paper. At a deeper level, these foldings get the topology wrong, introducing many gaps (boundaries) in the surface, which results in flimsy foldings in practice. We develop a new algorithm designed specifically for the practical folding of real paper into complicated polyhedral models. We prove that the algorithm correctly folds any oriented polyhedral manifold, plus an arbitrarily small amount of additional structure on one side of the surface (so for closed manifolds, inside the model). This algorithm is the first to attain the watertight property: for a specified cutting of the manifold into a topological disk with boundary, the folding maps the boundary of the paper to within {\$}\epsilon{\$} of the specified boundary of the surface (in Fr{\'{e}}chet distance). Our foldings also have the geometric feature that every convex face is folded seamlessly, i.e., as one unfolded convex polygon of the piece of paper. This work provides the theoretical underpinnings for Origamizer, freely available software written by the second author, which has enabled practical folding of many complex polyhedral models such as the Stanford bunny.},

Here, by taking advantage of the wireless, scalable and spatiotemporally selective capabilities that light allows, we show that soft microrobots consisting of photoactive liquid-crystal elastomers can be driven by structured monochromatic light to perform sophisticated biomimetic motions. We realize continuum yet selectively addressable artificial microswimmers that generate travelling-wave motions to self-propel without external forces or torques, as well as microrobots capable of versatile locomotion behaviours on demand. Both theoretical predictions and experimental results confirm that multiple gaits, mimicking either symplectic or antiplectic metachrony of ciliate protozoa, can be achieved with single microswimmers. The principle of using structured light can be extended to other applications that require microscale actuation with sophisticated spatiotemporal coordination for advanced microrobotic technologies.},

In order to improve the propulsion efficiency, movement capability and situation awareness, last studies have been directed on biomimetic robots. Over millions of years in a vast and often hostile realm, fish have evolved swimming capabilities far superior in many ways to what has been achieved by nautical technology. Instinctively, they use their superbly streamlined bodies to exploit fluid-mechanical principles, achieving extraordinary propulsion efficiencies, acceleration and manoeuvrability. Their solutions achieved the best performances based on aspects like preys hunting and living conditions. Looking at nature for inspiration as to how design an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle can significantly improve its flexibility and efficiency. This paper presents an examination of the state of the art on biomimetic robotic fishes, underlining the reasons why bio-inspiration can be a winning move and discussing how fish swimming can be the line of sight of the future locomotion technology. The paper concludes with a novel mechanism proposal, designed to produce optimal oscillatory motion between the flexible parts constituting the hull of the robotic fish.},

Traditional hydrogels are limited in short-term usage under room temperature, as it is difficult to retain water under cold or hot environment. Inspired by the antifreezing/antiheating behaviors from nature, and based on mussel chemistry, an adhesive and conductive hydrogel is developed with long-lasting moisture lock-in capability and extreme temperature tolerance, which is formed in a binary-solvent system composed of water and glycerol. Polydopamine (PDA)-decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are incorporated into the hydrogel, which assign conductivity to the hydrogel and serve as nanoreinforcements to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The catechol groups on PDA and viscous glycerol endow the hydrogel with high tissue adhesiveness. Particularly, the hydrogel is thermal tolerant to maintain all the properties under extreme wide tempreature spectrum (−20 or 60 °C) or stored for a long term. In summary, this mussel-inspired hydrogel is a promising material for self-adhesive bioelectronics to detect biosignals in cold or hot environments, and also as a dressing to protect skin from injuries related to frostbites or burns.},

By incorporating artificial evolutionary and developmental processes, the system allows to evolve complete creatures (brain, body, developmental properties, sensory and control system, etc.) for different task environments. Whether the evolved creatures will resemble animals or plants is in general not known a priori, and depends on the specific task environment set up by the experimenter. In this regard, the system may offer a unique opportunity to explore differences and similarities between these two worlds. Different material properties can be simulated and optimized, from a continuum of soft/stiff materials, to the interconnection of heterogeneous structures, both found in animals and plants alike. The adopted genetic encoding and simulation environment are particularly suitable in order to evolve distributed sensory and control systems, which play a particularly important role in plants. After a general description of the system some case studies will be presented, focusing on the emergent properties of the evolved creatures. Particular emphasis will be on some unifying concepts that are thought to play an important role in the emergence of intelligent and adaptive behavior across both the animal and plant kingdoms, such as morphological computation and morphological developmental plasticity. Overall, with this paper we hope to draw attention on set of tools, methodologies, ideas and results which may be relevant to researchers interested in plant-inspired robotics and intelligence.},

With an increasing number of robots needing to interact with humans and unstructured environments, there is a need for soft robots capable of sustaining large deformation while inducing little pressure or damage when maneuvering through confined spaces. The emergence of soft robotics offers the prospect of applying soft actuators as artificial muscles in robots, replacing traditional rigid actuators. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are recognized as one of the most promising soft actuation technologies due to the facts that: i) dielectric elastomers are kind of soft, motion-generating materials that resemble natural muscle of humans in terms of force, strain (displacement per unit length or area) and actuation pressure/ density; ii) dielectric elastomers can produce large voltage-induced deformation. In this survey, we first introduce the so-called DEAs emphasizing the key points of working principle, key components and electromechanical modeling approaches. Then, different DEA-driven soft robots, including wearable/humanoid robots, walking/serpentine robots, flying robots and swimming robots, are reviewed.

abstract = {Research on the adhesive locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is gaining renewed interest as it provides a source of guidance for the design of soft biomimetic robots that can perform functions currently not achievable by conventional rigid vehicles. The locomotion of terrestrial gastropods is driven by a train of periodic muscle contractions (pedal waves) and relaxations (interwaves) that propagate from their tails to their heads. These ventral waves interact with a thin layer of mucus secreted by the animal that transmits propulsive forces to the ground. The exact mechanism by which these propulsive forces are generated is still a matter of controversy. Specifically, the exact role played by the complex rheological and adhesive properties of the mucus is not clear. To provide quantitative data that could shed light on this question, we use a newly developed technique to measure, with high temporal and spatial resolution, the propulsive forces that terrestrial gastropods generate while crawling on smooth flat surfaces. The traction force measurements demonstrate the importance of the finite yield stress of the mucus in generating thrust and are consistent with the surface of the ventral foot being lifted with the passage of each pedal wave. We also show that a forward propulsive force is generated beneath each stationary interwave and that this net forward component is balanced by the resistance caused by the outer rim of the ventral foot, which slides at the speed of the center of mass of the animal. Simultaneously, the animal pulls the rim laterally inward. Analysis of the traction forces reveals that the kinematics of the pedal waves is far more complex than previously thought, showing significant spatial variation (acceleration/deceleration) as the waves move from the tail to the head of the animal.},

The problem consists in distributing a given amount of material in a specified domain modelled by a fixed finite element mesh in order to minimize the compliance. As the design variables can only take two values in- dicating the presence or absence of material (1 and 0), this prob- lem is intrinsically discrete. Here, it is solved by a mathemati- cal programming method working in the dual space and specially designed to handle discrete variables. This method is very well- suited to topology optimization, because it is particularly efficient for problems with a large number of variables and a small number of constraints. To ensure the existence of a solution, the perime- ter of the solid parts is bounded. A computer program including analysis and optimization has been developed. As it is specialized for regular meshes, the computational time is drastically reduced. Some classical 2-D and new 3-D problems are solved, with up to 30,000 design variables. Extensions to multiple load cases and to gravity loads are also examined.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first practical method for "origamizing" or obtaining the folding pattern that folds a single sheet of material into a given polyhedral surface without any cut. The basic idea is to tuck fold a planar paper to form a three-dimensional shape. The main contribution is to solve the inverse problem; the input is an arbitrary polyhedral surface and the output is the folding pattern. Our approach is to convert this problem into a problem of laying out the polygons of the surface on a planar paper by introducing the concept of tucking molecules. We investigate the equality and inequality conditions required for constructing a valid crease pattern. We propose an algorithm based on two-step mapping and edge splitting to solve these conditions. The two-step mapping precalculates linear equalities and separates them from other conditions. This allows an interactive manipulation of the crease pattern in the system implementation. We present the first system for designing three-dimensional origami, enabling a user can interactively design complex spatial origami models that have not been realizable thus far.},

abstract = {M any military and commercial applications for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been identified and numerous vehicles are under development. Many of these vehicles have a need to stow their wings and control surfaces into very small volumes to permit gun launch or packaging into aircraft mounted aerial drop assemblies. One technology that has shown promise in achieving this goal is the inflatable wing. Coincidentally, aircraft developers and researchers have identified a need for aircraft components that can morph to provide performance enhancements over traditional wing and tail assemblies, through the elimination of mechanical actuation system complexity and improved aerodynamics. The combination of the inflatable and morphing system technologies has lead to a unique approach for small UAV platforms with deployable, controllable wings that may also facilitate transition through multiple flight regimes. Inflatable wings have been in existence for decades and have found application in manned aircraft, UAVs, munitions control surfaces, and Lighter Than Air (LTA) vehicles. Recent system design challenges have ushered advances in the areas of materials, manufacturing, and configuration that have advanced this technology into a practical form for near term application. Inflatable wings can be packed into volumes tens of times smaller than their deployed volume without damaging the structural integrity of the wing. Deployment can occur on the ground or in flight in less than one second depending on the size of the wing and the type of inflation system used.},

This undulating fin is a segmental anal fin that produces sinusoidal wave to propel the robot. The relationship between the individual fin segment and phase angles with the overall fin trajectory has also been discussed. This propulsive force can be adjusted and directed for fish robot manoeuvre by a mechanical system with two servomotors. These servomotors regulate the direction and depth of swimming. A wireless remote control system is designed to adjust the servomotors which enables us to control revolution, speed and phase differences of neighbor servomotors of fins. Finally, Field trials are conducted in an outdoor pool to demonstrate the relationship between robotic fish speed and fin parameters like phase difference, the number of phase and undulatory amplitude.},

abstract = {Developing new smart hydrogel systems and new fabrication methods is critical for fundamental research and industrial applications, particularly in the intelligent human-machine field, but still faces great challenges. In this work, we present bilayer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/graphene oxide (polyNIPAM/GO) hydrogels with dual thermo- and near-infrared (NIR)-responsive properties using a simple, in situ polymerization-centrifugation method. By tuning the GO concentration and centrifugation speed, a transparent polyNIPAM layer and a dark-brown GO-rich layer are formed, where each layer displays distinct network structures and swelling behavior. Due to the asymmetric double-layer structure, the polyNIPAM/GO bilayer hydrogels enable one to realize fast, controllable, bidirectional bending under thermal or NIR stimulation within 1 min, and the bending orientation and degree can be reversibly, repeatedly, and precisely controlled by the temperature- or NIR-induced cooperative swelling-shrinking properties of both layers. Based on the reversible, bi-directional bending nature of polyNIPAM/GO hydrogels, we further design two proof-of-concept hydrogel actuators to highlight the advantages of this hydrogel system: one acts as a wiggler to mimic robot arms to move objects, while the other serves as an electric switch to turn on/off a light. In addition, our polymerization-centrifugation method can also be used to prepare polyNIPAM/SiO2 bilayer hydrogels, demonstrating its general applicability to other polyNIPAM-nanoparticle hydrogels with a bilayer structure. This work provides both a new fabrication method and hybrid hydrogel systems for the development of smart, programmable, and versatile hydrogel-based actuators.},

abstract = {and micro valves are crucial components for achieving these advanced platforms. [ 3 ] Thin-fi lm piezoelectric actuators promise reliable operation and high throughput, however com-plex motions and fl exible deformations, observed in natural systems, are hard to achieve. For example, aortic valves, one of the most frequently diseased tissues, are repaired by trans-planting a synthetic mechanical device or an allograft tissue alternative. These artifi cial ones are far from the original organs whose specialized motions are achieved by fl exible hier-archically structured tissues with complex architectures. [ 4 ] On the other hand, hydrogel-based soft actuators are promising [ 5 ] due to the large extent to which they can be deformed in aqueous media, thereby conforming to an architecture that mimics natural systems. Large complex 3D architectures can be fabricated with ease, if spontaneous chemical reactions are involved in their fabrication method. Moreover, 3D ink-jet printing is reportedly applicable to the production of these polymer-based actuation systems. [ 1 ] We here demonstrate adaptive microarchitectures that exhibit a special peristaltic motion by employing hydrogel actuation on bilayered materials. The surface architectures were designed by mimicking wrinkles in nature. The organ, skin, is a good example of wrinkles with an adaptive response, where wrin-kles appear and disappear depending on the movement of the muscles underneath. Here, greatly simplifying, these surface wrinkles form on a bilayered material of a crust top layer (skin) and an elastic bottom layer (muscles). As the bottom layer con-tracts (or the top layer swells), stress-driven instabilities are gen-erated at the interface of the layers. The accumulated stress is then released through the formation of wrinkles on the crust layer. Such stimuli-responsive wrinkles were reported on arti-fi cial bilayered materials prepared from elastomers or resins. [ 6 ] Nevertheless, artifi cial wrinkles, which exhibit large deforma-tions and undergo reversible adaptive response in liquids, are still challenging and are highly required to exploit applications in biological systems. In the present study, we designed and fab-ricated a bilayered structure made of PNIPAM and hybrid silica (Figure 1 a). 3-(Methacryloxy)propyl triethoxysilane was used as a silica source to allow copolymerization with NIPAM and a cross-linker (N,N′ -methylenebis(acrylamide), MBA) at the interface of the heterogeneous two layers. The thickness of the hybrid silica layer was tuned from 680 nm to 1.5 µm by using Pluronic F127 as a viscosity improver. This approach allows the strong adhesion at the interface and, most importantly, the complex actuation in liquid phase. PNIPAM undergoes shape change at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), [ 7 ] and thereby wrinkles of submillimeter dimensions appear and disappear as a function of the changing environmental temperature. Signifi cantly large deformations ({\textgreater}40{\%}), due to the fl exibility of NIPAM hydrogel, could be attained to achieve biomimicking microstructures, Soft microactuators with stimuli-responsive tunable chem-istries are highly demanded in complex multifunctional and biocompatible microdevice platforms including microelec-tromechanical systems and lab-on-a-chip. Developing multi-functional hydrogel actuators is especially of signifi cance for the nano/micro artifi cial anatomies, which perform func-tions such as transportation, selection, recognition, and others. Here we demonstrate adaptive surface wrinkles, which exhibit a peristaltic motion and a size selective transportation of micro-objects on bilayered soft materials under thermal stimulus. The bilayered materials made of thermorespon-sive poly(N-iso-propylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and hybrid silica form responsive wrinkles of submillimeter dimensions with temperature variation. This hydrogel-based actuation works at a quasi-physiological environment, which meets the crit-ical requirement for artifi cial alternatives in bioapplications. Rational design of autonomous actuators is possible through the present strategy because the formation of microarchitec-tures is driven through a versatile physical process, buckling. Complex multifunctional microdevice platforms are required for several areas of engineering and sciences, for example to provide biological insights into cells and tissues.

We recently developed a hydrogel with a layered structure consisting of cofacially oriented electrolyte nanosheets. Because this unusual geometry imparts a large anisotropic electrostatic repulsion to the hydrogel interior, the hydrogel resisted compression orthogonal to the sheets but readily deformed along parallel shear. Building on this concept, here we show a hydrogel actuator that operates by modulating its anisotropic electrostatics in response to changes of electrostatic permittivity associated with a lower critical solution temperature transition. In the absence of substantial water uptake and release, the distance between the nanosheets rapidly expands and contracts on heating and cooling, respectively, so that the hydrogel lengthens and shortens significantly, even in air. An L-shaped hydrogel with an oblique nanosheet configuration can thus act as a unidirectionally proceeding actuator that operates without the need for external physical biases.},

The body plan of this robot is inspired by the phylum Annelida and consists of three-dimensional printed voice coil actuators, which are connected by flexible silicone membranes. Each electromagnetic actuator engages with its neighbor to compress or extend the membrane of each segment, and the sequence in which they are actuated results in an earthworm-inspired peristaltic motion. We find that a minimum of three segments is required for locomotion, but due to our modular design, robots of any length can be quickly and easily assembled.

Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot's spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator's configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

abstract = {Added to their high dexterity and ability to conform to complex shapes, continuum robots can be further improved to provide safer interaction with their environment. Indeed, controlling their stiffness is one of the most challenging yet promising research topics. We propose a tubular stiffening sheath as a replaceable cover for small-diameter continuum robots to temporarily increase the stiffness in a certain configuration. In this article, we assess and compare performances of two different stiffening modalities: Granular and layer jamming, provide arguments for material selection and experimental results for stiffness with respect to lateral and axial applied forces. Furthermore, we detected empirically additional effects relating sheath stiffness to material parameters and added to recent investigations in the state of the art, which are based exclusively on material roughness. Finally, we integrated the selected layer jamming material in a miniaturized sheath (13 mm outer diameter, 2.5 mm wall thickness) and covered a tendon-actuated continuum robot with it. Experimental characterization of the behavior with respect to applied external forces was performed via stiffness measurements and proved that the initial tendon-actuated continuum robot stiffness can be improved by a factor up to 24.},

The elasticity and strength range of this hydrogel can be customized according to application requirements by simple alterations in the recipe. Furthermore, we incorporated Agar/PAM hydrogel into our highly constrained soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) design and eventually produced SPAs with escalated capabilities, such as larger range of motion, higher force output, and power efficiency.

The robot is able to execute these directed jumps while carrying the required fuel, pneumatics, control electronics, and battery.

Major challenges towards practically viable actuators are the achievement of large electromechanical deformation, fast switching response, low operating voltage and durable operation. Here we report a new electroactive actuator composed of self-assembled sulphonated block copolymers and ionic liquids. The new actuator demonstrated improvements in actuation properties over other polymer actuators reported earlier, large generated strain (up to 4{\%}) without any signs of back relaxation. In particular, the millimetre-scale displacements obtained for the actuators, with rapid response ({\textless}1 s) at sub-1-V conditions over 13,500 cycles in air, have not been previously reported in the literature. The key to success stems from the evolution of the unique hexagonal structure of the polymer layer with domain size gradients beneath the cathode during actuation, which promotes the bending motion of the actuators.},

The meta-analysis is restricted to five main types of actuators: shape memory alloys (SMAs), fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs), shape morphing polymers (SMPs), dielectric electro-activated polymers (DEAPs), and magnetic/electro-magnetic actuators (E/MAs). In exploring and comparing the capabilities of these actuators, the focus was on eight different aspects: compliance, topology-geometry, scalability-complexity, energy efficiency, operation range, modality, controllability, and technological readiness level (TRL).

abstract = {In the human body, many soft tissues with hierarchically ordered composite structures, such as cartilage, skeletal muscle, the corneas, and blood vessels, exhibit highly anisotropic mechanical strength and functionality to adapt to complex environments. In artificial soft materials, hydrogels are analogous to these biological soft tissues due to their "soft and wet" properties, their biocompatibility, and their elastic performance. However, conventional hydrogel materials with unordered homogeneous structures inevitably lack high mechanical properties and anisotropic functional performances; thus, their further application is limited. Inspired by biological soft tissues with well-ordered structures, researchers have increasingly investigated highly ordered nanocomposite hydrogels as functional biological engineering soft materials with unique mechanical, optical, and biological properties. These hydrogels incorporate long-range ordered nanocomposite structures within hydrogel network matrixes. Here, the critical design criteria and the state-of-the-art fabrication strategies of nanocomposite hydrogels with highly ordered structures are systemically reviewed. Then, recent progress in applications in the fields of soft actuators, tissue engineering, and sensors is highlighted. The future development and prospective application of highly ordered nanocomposite hydrogels are also discussed.},

Their slender arms, being highly agile and dexterous, often involve intense deformations, which are hard to simulate accurately, while simultaneously ensuring numerical stability and low diffusion of the transient motion results. Within the immersed-boundary framework, this paper focuses on an arm geometry performing prescribed motions that reflect octopus locomotion. The method is compared with a finite-volume numerical approach to determine the mesh requirements that must be employed for sufficiently capturing, not only the near wall viscous flow, but also the off-body vortical flow field in intense forced motions. The objective is to demonstrate and exploit the generality of the immersed boundary approach to complex numerical simulations of deforming geometries. Incorporation of arm deformation was found to increase the output thrust of a single-arm system. It was further found that sculling motion combined with arm undulations provides an effective propulsive scheme for an octopus-like arm.},

abstract = {The paper presents a nonlinear Finite Element (FE) algorithm to simulate the inhomogeneous steady swelling of polymeric gels. The algorithm is developed based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic part and a swelling part. The corresponding constitutive framework and linearization of the FE equation are elaborated, which leads to an equivalent body force driving the materials to swell. A staggered iterative procedure is designed to ensure the strongly coupled chemical and mechanical fields to reach the equilibrium state simultaneously. The constitutive equations are constructed in the framework of the volumetric-isochoric splitting of the free energy function, which is helpful both for a different treatment of the incompressible part in the FE equation and for a physical interpretation of the coupling effects between the chemical and mechanical fields. In the present work, an additive free energy function, coupling the contributions of the Flory-Huggins model and the non-Gauss statistical-mechanical model, is adopted and the corresponding consistent tangent modulus in the current configuration is also derived. To implement the FE algorithm, two two-dimensional (2D) elements and one three-dimensional (3D) element are developed, which are validated by some analytical solutions, such as free swelling of gels in 2D and 3D cases, squeezing a swollen gel with uniform pressure and the constrained swelling of a single-layer and a core-shell gel ring. The algorithm is also proved to be capable of handling the surface instabilities and some engineering applications such as hydrogel-based composite beams and thin films.},

Here we demonstrate a new reversible shape-changing component design concept enabled by 3D printing two stimuli responsive polymers-shape memory polymers and hydrogels-in prescribed 3D architectures. This approach uses the swelling of a hydrogel as the driving force for the shape change, and the temperature-dependent modulus of a shape memory polymer to regulate the time of such shape change. Controlling the temperature and aqueous environment allows switching between two stable configurations - the structures are relatively stiff and can carry load in each - without any mechanical loading and unloading. Specific shape changing scenarios, e.g., based on bending, or twisting in prescribed directions, are enabled via the controlled interplay between the active materials and the 3D printed architectures. The physical phenomena are complex and nonintuitive, and so to help understand the interplay of geometric, material, and environmental stimuli parameters we develop 3D nonlinear finite element models. Finally, we create several 2D and 3D shape changing components that demonstrate the role of key parameters and illustrate the broad application potential of the proposed approach.},

Here we report an unprecedented hydrogel actuator that enables not only a peristaltic crawling motion but also reversing its direction. Our cylindrically processed hydrogel contains gold nanoparticles for photothermal conversion, a thermoresponsive polymer network for switching the electrical permittivity of the gel interior, and cofacially oriented 2D electrolytes (titanate nanosheets; TiNSs) to synchronously change their anisotropic electrostatic repulsion. When a hydrogel, which was designed to include cofacially oriented TiNSs along the cylindrical gel axis, is pointwisely photoirradiated with a visible-light laser, it spatiotemporally expands immediately ({\textless}0.5 s) and largely (80 {\%} of its original length) in an isovolumetric manner. When the irradiation spot is moved along the cylindrical gel axis, the hydrogel undergoes peristaltic crawling due to quick and sequential elongation/contraction events and moves oppositely toward the laser scanning direction. Thus, when the scanning direction is switched, the crawling direction is reversed. When gold nanorods are used in place of gold nanoparticles, the hydrogel becomes responsive to a near-infrared light, which can deeply penetrate into bio tissues.},

One of the coils was excited with an alternating current which caused a voltage to be induced in two other coils. A return spring was used to return the core to its initial position after it has been moved. The sensor was pressed against the surface of the object whose stiffness was going to be measured. The position of the core in this state was depended on the stiffness of the given object and the spring constant and was measured by measuring the change in the induced voltage in secondary coils. The proposed sensor was capable of measuring two contact parameters namely the applied force and the stiffness of the object.

A motorized assistive robot is applied to the right knee joint to provide stance support. The metrics related to global stability (the maximum Floquet multiplier, max FM), local stability (short-term and long-term divergence exponents, {\$}\backslashlambda {\_}{\{}\backslashtext {\{}s{\}}{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda {\_}{\{}\backslashtext {\{}l{\}}{\}}{\$} ), and variability (median absolute deviation, MAD) are considered. These metrics are derived for bilateral hip, knee, and ankle joint angles. Additionally, a biomechanical metric, the minimum margin of stability is assessed. Experiments are conducted on 11 healthy participants with different robot controllers. The max FM and {\$}\backslashlambda {\_}{\{}\backslashtext {\{}s{\}}{\}}{\$} yield statistically significant results, showing that the unassisted (left) leg is more stable in right knee assistance conditions when compared to the normal walking condition due to inter-limb coordination. Moreover, MAD and {\$}\backslashlambda {\_}{\{}\backslashtext {\{}l{\}}{\}}{\$} show that the variability and chaotic order of walking pattern during assistance are lower than those of normal walking. The proposed control strategy (automatic impedance tuning, AIT) improves local and orbital gait stability compared to existing controllers such as finite-state machine (FSM). The assessment of dynamic gait stability presented in this paper provides insights for further improving control strategies of assistive robots to help a user reach improved gait stability while maintaining appropriate variability.},

abstract = {Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring Materials Scientists in the design of novel materials.$\backslash$nTheir defining characteristics, hierarchy, multifunctionality, and self-healing capability, are illustrated. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. The basic building blocks are described, starting with the 20 amino acids and proceeding to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides–saccharides. These, on their turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of ‘soft tissues' and are also present in most biominerals. There are over 1000 proteins, and we describe only the principal ones, with emphasis on collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The ‘hard' phases are primarily strengthened by minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases are discussed: hydroxyapatite, silica, and aragonite.$\backslash$nUsing the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are presented. Selected systems in each class are described with emphasis on the relationship between their structure and mechanical response. A fifth class is added to this: functional biological materials, which have a structure developed for a specific function: adhesion, optical properties, etc.$\backslash$nAn outgrowth of this effort is the search for bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methodologies of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. The new frontiers reside in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems; these involve nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures. Although this approach is still in its infancy, it will eventually lead to a plethora of new materials systems as we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of growth and the structure of biological systems.},

For the photoactuator design, the energy conversion route and structure assembly are two important parts, which directly affect the performance of the photoactuators. In particular, the architectural designs at the molecular, nano-, micro-, and macro- level, are found to play a significant role in accumulating molecular-scale strain/stress to macroscale strain/stress. Here, recent progress on photoactuators based on photochemical and photothermal effects is summarized, followed by a discussion of the important assembly strategies for the amplification of the photoresponsive components at nanoscale to macroscopic scale motions. The application advancement of current photoactuators is also presented. },

abstract = {A hybrid manufacturing paradigm is introduced that combines pop-up book microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing with soft-lithographic techniques to produce millimeter-scale mechanisms with embedded sensing and user-defined distributed compliance. This method combines accuracy, flexibility in material selection, scalability, and topological complexity with soft, biocompatible materials and microfluidics, paving the way for applications of soft fluid-powered biomedical robotics. This paper proposes two classes of fully soft fluidic microactuators and two integration strategies to demonstrate the hybrid soft pop-up actuators. Fatigue properties, blocked torque, maximum deflection, stiffness, and maximum speed are analyzed and the performance of the hybrid mechanisms is compared to their fully soft counterparts. The manufacturing approach allows integrating capacitive sensing elements in the mechanisms to achieve proprioceptive actuation. Multiple hybrid soft pop-up actuators are combined into a multiarticulated robotic arm that is integrated with current flexible endoscopes to improve distal dexterity and enable tissue retraction in an ex vivo proof of concept experiment.},

abstract = {The principle of series elastic actuation offers considerable advantages for haptic displays compared to stiff actuators. The interaction force between motor and load is directly proportional to their relative position, which corresponds to the elongation of the elastic element. This way, the torque control task is transformed to a position control task, which comes natural to traditional DC motors. In this paper, several existing control strategies are analyzed and compared with respect to passivity concerns. Cascaded control with a fast inner velocity loop results to be the best option. Based on the analysis, boundaries for the parameters are presented, such that the force controller may contain integral action without jeopardizing passivity.},

abstract = {Significant efforts have been made to develop highly tough hydrogels towards many scientific and industrial applications. However, most of the as-prepared tough hydrogels lose their mechanical strength and toughness when they swell in aqueous solution. Current knowledge about the swelling-induced mechanical property changes mainly stems from single-network (SN) hydrogels and chemically linked double-network (DN) hydrogels, but little is known about the swelling mechanical properties of hybrid physically-chemically linked DN gels. Here, we synthesized hybrid agar/PAM DN hydrogels combining a physically cross-linked first network of agar and a covalently cross-linked second network of polyacrylamide (PAM), with particular attention paid to the relationship between the swelling and mechanical properties of the hydrogels. The optimal agar/PAM DN gels achieved a tensile stress of [similar]1.0 MPa and a toughness of [similar]3988 J m-2 in the as-prepared state and a tensile stress of 1.4 MPa and a toughness of [similar]3960 J m-2 in the swollen state. The agar/PAM DN gels can readily achieve swelling ratios in the range of [similar]1.3-3.6 by adjusting the concentrations of the first network, the second network, and the crosslinker. The swelling capacity of the agar/PAM DN gels was balanced by the competition between the "non-swellable" agar network and the "highly swellable" PAM network, indicating that the first and second networks play different roles in the swelling-induced mechanical properties of the agar/PAM gels. Based on a comparison of the tearing and tensile behaviors of the hybrid DN gels between both as-prepared and swollen gels, we proposed a swelling-induced fracture mechanism that is different from those of SN and chemically-linked DN hydrogels. This work not only demonstrates a very tough swollen DN gel with a hybrid network, but also provides a better understanding of the swelling characteristics of hybrid DN gels, which hopefully helps to offer some valuable insights into the development of next-generation tough hydrogel materials in both as-prepared and swollen states.},

All these applications require structures whose shape can be actively controlled, both for deployment and to conform to the surrounding environment. While most current reconfigurable designs are application specific, here we present a mechanical metamaterial with tunable shape, volume and stiffness. Our approach exploits a simple modular origami-like design consisting of rigid faces and hinges, which are connected to form a periodic structure consisting of extruded cubes. We show both analytically and experimentally that the transformable metamaterial has three degrees of freedom, which can be actively deformed into numerous specific shapes through embedded actuation. The proposed metamaterial can be used to realize transformable structures with arbitrary architectures, highlighting a robust strategy for the design of reconfigurable devices over a wide range of length scales.},

abstract = {Shape-shifting of flat materials into the desired 3D configuration is an alternative design route for fabrication of complex 3D shapes, which provides many benefits such as access to the flat material surface and the ability to produce well-described motions. The advanced production techniques that primarily work in 2D could then be used to add complex surface features to the flat material. The combination of complex 3D shapes and surface-related functionalities has a wide range of applications in biotechnology, actuators/sensors, and engineering of complex metamaterials. Here, we categorize the different programming strategies that could be used for planning the shape-shifting of soft matter based on the type of stresses generated inside the flat material and present an overview of the ways those mechanisms could be used to achieve the desired 3D shapes. Stress gradients through the thickness of the material, which generate out-of-plane bending moments, and compressive in-plane stresses that result in out-of-plane buckling constitute the major mechanisms through which shape-shifting of the flat matter could be programmed. We review both programming strategies with a focus on the underlying physical principles, which are highly scalable and could be applied to other structures and materials. The techniques used for programming the time sequence of shape-shifting are discussed as well. Such types of so-called “sequential” shape-shifting enable achieving more complex 3D shapes, as the kinematics of the movements could be planned in time to avoid collisions. Ultimately, we discuss what 3D shapes could be achieved through shape-shifting from flat soft matter and identify multiple areas of application.},

abstract = {Background and Aims The carnivorous plant Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) produces a rosette of leaves: each leaf is divided into a lower part called the lamina and an upper part, the trap, with sensory trigger hairs on the adaxial surface. The trap catches prey by very rapid closure, within a fraction of a second of the trigger hairs being touched twice. Generation of action potentials plays an important role in closure. Because electrical signals are involved in reduction of the photosynthetic rate in different plant species, we hypothesized that trap closure and subsequent movement of prey in the trap will result in transient downregulation of photosynthesis, thus representing the energetic costs of carnivory associated with an active trapping mechanism, which has not been previously described.MethodsTraps were enclosed in a gas exchange cuvette and the trigger hairs irritated with thin wire, thus simulating insect capture and retention. Respiration rate was measured in darkness (RD). In the light, net photosynthetic rate (AN), stomatal conductance (gs) and intercellular CO2 concentration (ci) were measured, combined with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Responses were monitored in the lamina and trap separately.Key ResultsIrritation of trigger hairs resulted in decreased AN and increased RD, not only immediately after trap closure but also during the subsequent period when prey retention was simulated in the closed trap. Stomatal conductance remained stable, indicating no stomatal limitation of AN, so ci increased. At the same time, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II ($\Phi$PSII) decreased transiently. The response was confined mainly to the digestive zone of the trap and was not observed in the lamina. Stopping mechanical irritation resulted in recovery of AN, RD and $\Phi$PSII.ConclusionsWe put forward the first experimental evidence for energetic demands and carbon costs during insect trapping and retention in carnivorous plants, providing a new insight into the cost/benefit model of carnivory.},

In this manuscript, we propose a novel two-component soft actuator design and design tool that produces actuators targeted towards these applications with enhanced mechanical performance and manufacturability. Our numerical models developed using the finite element method can predict the actuator behavior at large mechanical strains to allow efficient design iterations for system optimization. Based on two distinctive actuator prototypes' (linear and bending actuators) experimental results that include free displacement and blocked-forces, we have validated the efficacy of the numerical models. The presented extensive investigation of mechanical performance for soft actuators with varying geometric parameters demonstrates the practical application of the design tool, and the robustness of the actuator hardware design, towards diverse soft robotic systems for a wide set of assistive wearable technologies, including replicating the motion of several parts of the human body.},

abstract = {Thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm)-based hydrogels are widely investigated for their ability to alter their physical properties (e.g. dimensions, swelling/deswelling) in response to change in temperature. Despite extensive research efforts, it is still challenging to control various aspects of thermoresponsive physical properties of PNIPAm hydrogels in an efficient and comprehensive manner using conventional small molecular crosslinkers due to their limited solubility and functional groups. Herein, thermoresponsive swelling/deswelling behavior of PNIPAm hydrogels is tuned in a wide range by hydrophilic polymeric crosslinkers with varying chain lengths. The concentration and molecular weight of the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) crosslinker are varied to control the swelling/deswelling behavior, drug release, and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAm-PEG hydrogels. Compared with PNIPAm hydrogels crosslinked with a conventional small molecular crosslinker, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide, greater degree and range of thermoresponsive swelling/deswelling as well as tunable LCST are demonstrated for PNIPAm-PEG hydrogels. In addition, more swelling-controlled PNIPAm-PEG hydrogels displayed more sustained and variable thermoresponsive drug release based on their crosslinking density, by modulating the hydrophobic transition of PNIPAm chains with hydrophilic PEG chains. In sum, various thermoresponsive properties of PNIPAm hydrogels could be controlled by hydrophilic polymeric crosslinkers, and this strategy could be applied to various hydrogel systems to control their physical properties for biomedical applications.},

abstract = {A custom centrifugal melt-spinning technique was used to prepare randomly arranged 3D fibre networks from commercially available shellac flakes. These fibre networks were implanted into thermally actuating poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-alginate hydrogels and then removed chemically to yield an interconnected porous gel structure. Pore diameter was capable of being controlled through the fibre-spinning temperature, where it was shown that shellac fibres spun at a lower temperature yielded larger diameter pores in the resultant gels. These gels demonstrated a fast actuation, with a 77 {\%} volume loss of a cylindrical sample in just 30 s when immersed in a 60 °C water bath. It was shown that the volume change mechanism overcame the well-known dimensional constraint, which has previously governed hydrogel swelling/de-swelling, through minimisation of the water diffusion distance from the gel to the porous network. With such rapidly actuating materials, potential applications for these hydrogels lie in thermally responsive valves and artificial muscles for soft robotics or microfluidics.},

abstract = {A novel pneumatic soft linear actuator Fiber-reinforced Origamic Robotic Actuator (FORA) is proposed with significant improvements on the popular McKibben-type actuators, offering nearly doubled motion range, substantially improved force profile, and significantly lower actuation pressure. The desirable feature set is made possible by a novel soft origamic chamber that expands radially while contracts axially when pressurized. Combining this new origamic chamber with a reinforcing fiber mesh, FORA generates very high traction force (over 150N) and very large contractile motion (over 50{\%}) at very low input pressure (100 kPa). We developed quasi-static analytical models both to characterize the motion and forces and as guidelines for actuator design. Fabrication of FORA mostly involves consumer-grade three-dimensional (3D) printing. We provide a detailed list of materials and dimensions. Fabricated FORAs were tested on a dedicated platform against commercially available pneumatic artificial muscles from Shadow and Festo to showcase its superior performances and validate the analytical models with very good agreements. Finally, a robotic joint was developed driven by two antagonistic FORAs, to showcase the benefits of the performance improvements. With its simple structure, fully characterized mechanism, easy fabrication procedure, and highly desirable performance, FORA could be easily customized to application requirements and fabricated by anyone with access to a 3D printer. This will pave the way to the wider adaptation and application of soft robotic systems.},

abstract = {A network of polymers can imbibe a large quantity of a solvent and swell, resulting in a gel. The swelling process can be markedly influenced by a mechanical load and geometric constraint. When the network, solvent, and mechanical load equilibrate, inside the gel the chemical potential of the solvent is homogeneous, but the concentration of the solvent and the deformation of the network can be inhomogeneous. We use the chemical potential of the solvent and the deformation gradient of the network as the independent variables of the free-energy function, and show that the boundary value problem of the swollen gel is equivalent to that of a hyperelastic solid. We implement this approach in the finite-element package, ABAQUS, and analyze examples of swelling-induced deformation, contact, and bifurcation. Because commercial software like ABAQUS is widely available, this work may provide a powerful tool to study complex phenomena in gels. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {— Soft robotics carries with the promise of making robots as capable and adaptable as biological creatures, but this will not be possible without the ability to perform self-sensing and control with precision and repeatability. In this paper, we seek to address this need with the development of a new pneumatically-actuated soft bending actuation module with integrated curvature sensing. We designed and fabricated two different versions of this module: one with a commercially available resistive flex sensor and the other with a magnetic curvature sensor of our own design, and used an external motion capture system to calibrate and verify the validity of these two modules. In addition, we used an iterative sliding mode controller to drive the modules through step curvature references to demonstrate the controllability of the modules as well as compare the usability of the two sensors. We found that the magnetic sensor returned noisy but accurate data, while the flex sensor was inaccurate and subject to drift but did not exhibit notable noise. Experimental results show that this phenomenon of drift from the flex sensor causes active feedback control of the bending actuator to exhibit significant positioning errors. This work demonstrates that our soft bending actuator can be controlled with repeatability and precision, and that our magnetic curvature sensor represents an improvement for use in closed-loop control of soft robotic devices.},

abstract = {We present a design methodology and manufacturing process for the construction of articulated three-dimensional microstructures with features on the micron to centimeter scale. Flexure mechanisms and assembly folds result from the bulk machining and lamination of alternating rigid and compliant layers, similar to rigid-flex printed circuit board construction. Pop-up books and other forms of paper engineering inspire designs consisting of one complex part with a single assembly degree of freedom. Like an unopened pop-up book, mechanism links reside on multiple interconnected layers, reducing interference and allowing folding mechanisms of greater complexity than achievable with a single folding layer. Machined layers are aligned using dowel pins and bonded in parallel. Using mechanical alignment that persists during bonding allows device layers to be anisotropically pre-strained, a feature we exploit to create self-assembling structures. These methods and three example devices are presented.},

abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot's Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {The ability to measure human hand motions and interaction forces is critical to improving our understanding of manual gesturing and grasp mechanics. This knowledge serves as a basis for developing better tools for human skill training and rehabilitation, exploring more effective methods of designing and controlling robotic hands, and creating more sophisticated human-computer interaction devices which use complex hand motions as control inputs. This paper presents work on the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a soft sensor-embedded glove which measures both hand motion and contact pressures during human gesturing and manipulation tasks. We design an array of liquid-metal embedded elastomer sensors to measure up to hundreds of Newtons of interaction forces across the human palm during manipulation tasks and to measure skin strains across phalangeal and carpal joints for joint motion tracking. The elastomeric sensors provide the mechanical compliance necessary to accommodate anatomical variations and permit a normal range of hand motion. We explore methods of assembling this soft sensor glove from modular, individually fabricated pressure and strain sensors and develop design guidelines for their mechanical integration. Experimental validation of a soft finger glove prototype demonstrates the sensitivity range of the designed sensors and the mechanical robustness of the proposed assembly method, and provides a basis for the production of a complete soft sensor glove from inexpensive modular sensor components.},

We identify energy density (joules/gram) and flow capacity (liters/gram) normalized by the mass of the entire fuel system (versus net fuel mass) as key metrics for soft robotic power systems.

This paper describes the design and fabrication of miniature soft EMAs that operate based on the Lorentz force principle. The actuators are fabricated from silicone polymer, liquid metal (LM) alloy (eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn), and magnetic (NdFeB) powder. They are small, intrinsically deformable, and can be fabricated using simple techniques. The central elements of the actuators are fine, 3D helical coil conductors, which are used as electromagnetic inductors. The coils are formed from stretchable filaments that are filled with a LM alloy. To achieve high power densities, the filaments themselves may be fabricated from colloids of EGaIn microdroplets in a silicone polymer matrix, allowing them to dissipate heat and accommodate high currents, and thus high forces. Millimeter-scale cylindrical actuators are demonstrated for linear high frequency motion and articulated devices for bending motion. These actuators are applied in a vibrotactile feedback display and in a miniature soft robotic gripper.

The method handles heterogeneous data sets, and leads to coherent schemes for compressing, denoising, and imputing missing entries across all data types simultaneously. It also admits a number of interesting interpretations of the low rank factors, which allow clustering of examples or of features.

Furthermore, such a formulation permits one to construct a variety of geometric tools which can be used to analyze common manufacturability concepts, such as tool access, part removability, and device support. In order to increase the speed of development, reduce the occurrence of manufacturing problems inherent with current design methods, and reduce the level of expertise required to develop new devices, the framework has been implemented in a new design tool called popupCAD, which is suited for the design and development of complex folded laminate devices.

abstract = {Origami engineering aims to combine origami principles with advanced materials to yield active origami shapes, which fold and unfold in response to external stimuli. This paper explores the potential and limitations of dielectric elastomers (DEs) as the enabling material in active origami engineering. DEs are compliant materials in which the coupled electro-mechanical actuation takes advantage of their low modulus and high breakdown strength. Until recently, prestraining of relatively thick DE materials was necessary in order to achieve the high electric fields needed to trigger electrostatic actuation without inducing a dielectric breakdown. Although prestrain improves the breakdown strength of the DE films and reduces the voltage required for actuation, the need for a solid frame to retain the prestrain state is a limitation for the practical implementation of DEs, especially for active origami structures. However, the recent availability of thinner DE materials (50 mu m, 130 mu m, 260 mu m) has made DEs a likely medium for active origami. In this work, the folding and unfolding of DE multilayered structures, along with the realization of origami-inspired 3D shapes, are explored. In addition, an exhaustive study on the fundamentals of DE actuation is done by directly investigating the thickness actuation mechanism and comparing their performance using different electrode types. Finally, changes in dielectric permittivity as a function of strain, electrode type and applied electric field are assessed and analyzed. These fundamental studies are key to obtaining more dramatic folding and to realizing active origami structures using DE materials.},

However, emerging technologies such as micro air vehicles, and microrobotics in general, demand high force, high displacement, low mass actuators. Utilization of generic piezoceramics and high performance composite materials coupled with intelligent use of geometry and novel driving techniques yields low cost, rapidly prototyped, ultra-high energy density bending actuators for use in such applications. The design is based upon a laminate plate theory model for a stacked multimorph cantilever actuator, encompassing all possible layups, layer anisotropies, internal and external excitations, and intrinsic and extrinsic geometries. Using these principles, we have fabricated 12 mg PZT bimorph actuators with greater than 2 J kg−1 energy density. This gives a performance increase of an order of magnitude or greater compared to existing commercially available piezoelectric bending actuators.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim. Reinforcing hydrogels with a rigid scaffold is a promising method to greatly expand the mechanical and physical properties of hydrogels. One of the challenges of creating hydrogel composites is the significant stress that occurs due to swelling mismatch between the water-swollen hydrogel matrix and the rigid skeleton in aqueous media. This stress can cause physical deformation (wrinkling, buckling, or fracture), preventing the fabrication of robust composites. Here, a simple yet versatile method is introduced to create "macroscale" hydrogel composites, by utilizing a rigid reinforcing phase that can relieve stress-induced deformation. A low-melting-point alloy that can transform from a load-bearing solid state to a free-deformable liquid state at relatively low temperature is used as a reinforcing skeleton, which enables the release of any swelling mismatch, regardless of the matrix swelling degree in liquid media. This design can generally provide hydrogels with hybridized functions, including excellent mechanical properties, shape memory, and thermal healing, which are often difficult or impossible to achieve with single-component hydrogel systems. Furthermore, this technique enables controlled electrochemical reactions and channel-structure templating in hydrogel matrices. This work may play an important role in the future design of soft robots, wearable electronics, and biocompatible functional materials.},

abstract = {In this paper, we aim to study the swimming performance of fish robots by using a statistical approach. A fish robot employing a carangiform swimming mode had been used as an experimental platform for the performance study. The experiments conducted aim to investigate the effect of various design parameters on the thrust capability of the fish robot with a flexible caudal fin. The controllable parameters associated with the fin include frequency, amplitude of oscillation, aspect ratio and the rigidity of the caudal fin. The significance of these parameters was determined in the first set of experiments by using a statistical approach. A more detailed parametric experimental study was then conducted with only those significant parameters. As a result, the parametric study could be completed with a reduced number of experiments and time spent. With the obtained experimental result, we were able to understand the relationship between various parameters and a possible adjustment of parameters to obtain a higher thrust. The proposed statistical method for experimentation provides an objective and thorough analysis of the effects of individual or combinations of parameters on the swimming performance. Such an efficient experimental design helps to optimize the process and determine factors that influence variability.},

abstract = {Motile plant structures (e.g., leaves, petals, cone scales, and capsules) are functionally highly robust and resilient concept generators for the development of biomimetic actuators for architecture. Here, a concise review of the state-of-the-art of plant movement principles and derived biomimetic devices is provided. Achieving complex and higher-dimensional shape changes and passive-hydraulic actuation at a considerable time scale, as well as mechanical robustness of the motile technical structures, is challenging. For example, almost all currently available bioinspired hydraulic actuators show similar limitations due to the poroelastic time scale. Therefore, a major challenge is increasing the system size to the meter range, with actuation times of minutes or below. This means that response speed and flow rate need significant improvement for the systems, and the long-term performance degradation issue of hygroscopic materials needs to be addressed. A theoretical concept for "escaping" the poroelastic regime is proposed, and the possibilities for enhancing the mechanical properties of passive-hydraulic bilayer actuators are discussed. Furthermore, the promising aspects for further studies to implement tropistic movement behavior are presented, i.e., movement that depends on the direction of the triggering stimulus, which can finally lead to "smart building skins" that autonomously and self-sufficiently react to changing environmental stimuli in a direction-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Creating complex spatial objects from a flat sheet of material using origami folding techniques has attracted atten- tion in science and engineering. In the present work, we use the geometric properties of partially folded zigzag strips to better describe the kinematics of known zigzag/herringbone-base folded sheet metamaterials such as Miura-ori. Inspired by the kinematics of a one–degree of freedom zigzag strip, we introduce a class of cellular folded mechanical metamaterials comprising different scales of zigzag strips. This class of patterns combines origami folding techniques with kirigami. Using analytical and numerical models, we study the key mechanical properties of the folded materials. We show that our class of patterns, by expanding on the design space of Miura-ori, is appropriate for a wide range of applications from mechanical metamaterials to deployable structures at small and large scales. We further show that, depending on the geometry, these materials exhibit either negative or positive in-plane Poisson's ratios. By introducing a class of zigzag-base materials in the current study, we unify the concept of in-plane Poisson's ratio for similar materials in the literature and extend it to the class of zigzag- base folded sheet materials.},

abstract = {Environmentally responsive (ER) hydrogels are hydrogels that can experience an abrupt volume change and hence hold or release a large amount of water under the change of certain environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, or an electric field. Because of their unique capability to achieve a large yet reversible volume change, hydrogels have been widely used in microfluidics and biomedical applications, such as hydrogel sensors and actuators for microfluidic channels, novel drug delivery systems, and scaffolding materials for tissue engineering. In most applications, ER hydrogels are used to create an isotropic volume change or one-dimensional motion by constraining the hydrogel in the other two directions. In this study, using finite element based simulations, actuator designs are demonstrated that can generate a variety of shape changes by carefully patterning ER hydrogels on a non-ER hydrogel matrix. In these designs, as the environment changes, the ER hydrogels undergo volume change under the constraints imposed by the non-ER matrix, causing an eigenstrain (mismatch strain) and hence the deformation of the non-ER matrix. By properly controlling the locations of the ER hydrogel sections with respect to the non-ER hydrogel matrix, one can achieve a desired deformation of the composite structure. As examples, designs of a single material actuator, one linear spring composite actuator, and two coil composite actuators are demonstrated. The feasibility to produce these actuators and the possible applications are discussed at the end of the article.},

abstract = {Many environmental conditions can influence the mechanical characteristics of the glucose-sensitive hydrogels. In this paper, a multi-effect-coupling glucose-stimulus (MECglu) model is developed to study the influence of environmental solution pH on the swelling behavior of soft smart hydrogels responding to change in surrounding blood glucose concentration. In order to characterize the chemo-electro-mechanical behaviors of the hydrogels, the model is composed of the Nernst-Planck type of diffusion-reaction partial differential equations for mobile species with consideration of the enzyme reaction catalyzed by the glucose oxidase and the catalase, the Poisson equation for electric potential, and the nonlinear equilibrium equation for mechanical large deformation of the glucose-sensitive hydrogel. In the MECglu model, the formulation of the fixed charge groups bound onto the corsslinked polymeric network is associated with the change of the ambient solution pH. Using these nonlinear coupled partial differential equations, we demonstrate that the computational mechanical deformation by the MECglu model consists well with the experimental observations published in the range of practical physiological glucose concentration from 0 to 16.5 mm (300 mg/ml). The simulations are also carried out for analysis of the influences of physiological pH on the distributive profiles of reacting and diffusive species concentrations and the electric potential as well as the mechanical deformation of the glucose-sensitive hydrogels. The simulations by the model can efficiently support the design and optimization of the insulin delivery system based on the glucose-sensitive hydrogels with the immobilized glucose oxidase and catalase. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Soft robots are compliant and durable, and thus potentially better-suited for swimming or crawling over rough terrain than conventional rigid robots. Biomimetic locomotion strategies are often implemented on soft robots, but are difficult to tune because of the complexity of mapping nonlinear mechanical systems to specific gait patterns. We propose an approach to soft robot control in which the robot is designed to physically realize a shape space (mechanically predefined body poses) to follow a theoretically optimal gait. Specifically in this paper we present an entirely soft snake robot designed to implement the prerequisite shape space for slithering gaits. When coupled with a geometric mechanics model relating serpentine shape sequences to displacement, appropriate gait patterns can be selected analytically based on the system's Lie bracket. We developed a modular, two-link soft robot and used the geometric mechanics model to identify several cyclic gait patterns for producing forward displacement. The gait patterns were tested on the soft robot and observed with a motion capture system to measure displacement and monitor shape sequences. Relative performance of the gait patterns is consistent with the geometric 'soap-bubble method' as a heuristic for gait optimization, which demonstrates the applicability of this approach to soft robot control and coordination.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to modelling carangiform fish-like swimming motion for multi-joint robotic fish so that they can obtain fish-like behaviours and mimic the body motion of carangiform fish. A given body motion function of fish swimming is firstly converted to a tail motion function which describes the tail motion relative to the head. Then, the tail motion function is discretized into a series of tail postures over time. Thirdly, a digital approximation method calculates the turning angles of joints in the tail to approximate each tail posture; and finally, these angles are grouped into a look-up table, or regressed to a time-dependent function, for practically controlling the tail motors in a multi-joint robotic fish. The paper made three contributions: tail motion relative to the head, an error function for digital approximation and regressing a look-up table for online optimization. To prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology, two basic swimming motion patterns, cruise straight and C-shape sharp turning, are modelled and implemented in our robotic fish. The experimental results show that the relative tail motion and the approximation error function are good choices and the proposed method is feasible. ?? 2010 Jilin University.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore the wide range of material properties attainable using a voxel-based freeform fabrication process, and demonstrate in simulation the versatility of fabricating with multiple materials in this manner. Design/methodology/approach - A representative interlocking voxel geometry was selected, and a nonlinear physics simulator was implemented to perform virtual tensile tests on blocks of assembled voxels of varying materials. Surface contact between tiles, plastic deformation of the individual voxels, and varying manufacturing precision were all modeled. Findings - By varying the precision, geometry, and material of the individual voxels, continuous control over the density, elastic modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion, ductility, and failure mode of the material is obtained. Also, the effects of several hierarchical voxel " microstructures" are demonstrated, resulting in interesting properties such as negative Poisson's ratio. Research limitations/implications - This analysis is a case study of a specific voxel geometry, which is representative of 2.5D interlocking shapes but not necessarily all types of interlocking voxels. Practical implications - The results imply that digital materials can exhibit widely varying and tunable properties in a single desktop fabrication process. Originality/value - The paper explores the vast potential of tunable materials, especially using the concept of voxel microstructure, applicable primarily to 3D voxel printers but also to other multi-material freeform fabrication processes. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited [ISSN 1355-2546].},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing the integral stiffness of solid elastic plates described by thin plate theory. Assuming the material volume and plate domain to be given, we use the plate thickness function as the design variable and take both maximum and minimum allowable thickness values into account. On the basis of a convenient tensorial formulation of the problem, where the governing equations are derived by variational analysis and constitute necessary conditions for stationarity, we develop an efficient and quite general numerical algorithm by means of which a number of stationary solutions for rectangular and axisymmetric annular plates with various boundary conditions are obtained. These numerical results enable us to investigate the optimization problem itself in terms of its major parameters, particularly the maximum and minimum values specified for the plate thickness. For problems associated with large ratios between these constraint values, plate designs with significant integral stiffeners are obtained. We find however, that these designs are only local optima and that a global optimal plate thickness function does generally neither exist within the class of smooth functions nor within the class of smooth functions with a finite number of discontinuities. In order to determine a global optimal solution associated with given thickness constraint values, it is therefore necessary to change the optimal design formulation. With implications for a number of similar two-dimensional optimization problems, our results offer valuable indications of the lines along which such changes should be performed. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {We have been interested in the synthesis of hydrogels with fast swelling kinetics and superabsorbent properties. To increase the water absorption rate, interconnected pores were introduced to the hydrogels. Since the pore size in the dried hydrogels is in the order of hundreds of micrometers, these hydrogels are called "superporous" hydrogels. Superporous hydrogels were synthesized by crosslinking polymerization of various vinyl monomers in the presence of gas bubbles formed by the chemical reaction of acid and NaHCO3. The polymerization process was optimized to capture the gas bubbles inside the synthesized hydrogels. The use of the NaHCO3/acid system allowed easy control of timing for gelation and foam formation. We found that PF127 was the best foam stabilizer for most of the monomer systems used in our study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures showed interconnected pores forming capillary channels. The capillary channels, which were critical for fast swelling, were preserved during drying by dehydrating water-swollen hydrogels with ethanol before drying. The ethanol-dehydrated superporous hydrogels reached equilibrium swelling within minutes. The equilibrium swelling time could be reduced to less than a minute with the use of a wetting agent. In our study, water moisture was used as a wetting agent since the amount of moisture content in the dried hydrogels easily could be controlled. Preparation of superporous hydrogels using the right blowing system, foam stabilizer, drying method, and wetting agent makes it possible to reduce the swelling time to less than a minute regardless of the size of the dried gels. The superporous hydrogels can be used where fast swelling and superabsorbent properties are critical.},

abstract = {Abstract In this study, we present a modular worm-like robot, which utilizes voice coils as a new paradigm in soft robot actuation. Drive electronics are incorporated into the actuators, providing a significant improvement in self-sufficiency when compared with existing soft robot actuation modes such as pneumatics or hydraulics. The body plan of this robot is inspired by the phylum Annelida and consists of three-dimensional printed voice coil actuators, which are connected by flexible silicone membranes. Each electromagnetic actuator engages with its neighbor to compress or extend the membrane of each segment, and the sequence in which they are actuated results in an earthworm-inspired peristaltic motion. We find that a minimum of three segments is required for locomotion, but due to our modular design, robots of any length can be quickly and easily assembled. In addition to actuation, voice coils provide audio input and output capabilities. We demonstrate transmission of data between segments by high-fr...},

abstract = {During the past decades, hydrogels have been introduced suitable as novel materials for a variety of applications such as biomedical engineering, sanitary products, agriculture, bioseparation, enhanced oil recovery, etc. They have been successfully used as superabsorbent materials and in drug delivery, cell encapsulation and tissue repair due to their high water content and consequent biocompatibility. Considering the fact that water retention in the hydrogels provides a suitable drug diffusion pathway; many hydrogel-based networks have been designed and fabricated as intelligent carriers of drugs. The rate and degree of hydrogel swelling are the most important parameters which control the release patterns of solvents and drugs from these polymeric networks. Therefore, the precise account of hydrogel behaviour as well as mathematical description of equilibrium swelling, dimensional changes due to solvent uptake, desorption and drug release profiles were the main objectives in many investigations. The objective of this manuscript is to give a brief review on existing mathematical models and theories in the field of hydrogel swelling as well as the description of the drug release mechanism from swelling-controlled networks. The most important properties of hydrogels relevant to their swelling behaviour as well as kinetics and thermodynamic of swelling are also presented.},

First, the movement of a live bluespotted ray was captured for the swimming mode and useful information to the biomimetic mechanism design. By virtue of the modular and reconfigurable design concept, an undulatory fin propulsion prototype was developed. With a proper experimental set-up, orthogonal experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of various fin design parameters on the propulsion speed, thrust, and power of the fish robot. The controllable fin parameters include frequency, amplitude, wavelength, fin shape, and undulatory mode. The significance of these parameters was also determined by using the variance analysis. The results demonstrate that the designed propulsor, imitating bluespotted rays with large expanded undulatory fins, is able to propel itself by changing various kinematic parameters. {\textcopyright}2012 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Novel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-clay (PNIPAM-clay) nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels with both excellent responsive bending and elastic properties are developed as temperature-controlled manipulators. The PNIPAM-clay NC structure provides the hydrogel with excellent mechanical property, and the thermoresponsive bending property of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel is achieved by designing an asymmetrical distribution of nanoclays across the hydrogel thickness. The hydrogel is simply fabricated by a two-step photo polymerization. The thermoresponsive bending property of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel is resulted from the unequal forces generated by the thermoinduced asynchronous shrinkage of hydrogel layers with different clay contents. The thermoresponsive bending direction and degree of the PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogel can be adjusted by controlling the thickness ratio of the hydrogel layers with different clay contents. The prepared PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogels exhibit rapid, reversible, and repeatable thermoresponsive bending/unbending characteristics upon heating and cooling. The proposed PNIPAM-clay NC hydrogels with excellent responsive bending property are demonstrated as temperature-controlled manipulators for various applications including encapsulation, capture, and transportation of targeted objects. They are highly attractive material candidates for stimuli-responsive smart soft robots in myriad fields such as manipulators, grippers, and cantilever sensors.},

Scanning electron microscope graphs reveal that the macroporous network structure of the hydrogels can be adjusted by applying different molecular weights of PEG during the polymerization reaction. The surface roughness of the hydrogels is also investigated using atomic force microscopy, and the results indicate that the surface of the PEG-modified gel is much rougher compared to that of the conventional PNIPAAm gel. The newly invented macroporous hydrogels exhibit much better properties as temperature-sensitive intelligent polymers. For instance, at a temperature below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), they absorb larger amounts of water and show obviously higher equilibrated swelling ratios in the aqueous medium. Particularly, due to their unique macroporous structure, the PEG-modified hydrogels show a tremendously faster response to the external temperature changes during deswelling and reswelling processes as the temperature cycles across the LCST. They can also shrink and lose water with dramatically rapid rates at temperatures above the LCST. The macroporous PNIPAAm gel has potential applications in controlled release of macromolecular active agents.},

This actuator can then serve as the basis for building viable, full-strength, and safe muscles for disabled patients, rehabilitation, human force amplification, telerobotics, and humanoid robotic systems. This paper presents a cell-based flexible actuator modeling methodology and the General Fingerprint Method for systematically and efficiently calculating the actuators' respective dynamic equations of motion. The cellular actuator arrays combine many flexible 'cells' in complex and varied topologies for combined large-scale motion. The cells can have varied internal dynamic models and common actuators such as piezoelectric, SMA, linear motor, and pneumatic technologies can fit the model by adding a flexible element in series with the actuator. The topology of the cellular actuator array lends it many of its properties allowing the final muscle to be catered to particular applications. The General Fingerprint Method allows for fast recalculation for different and/or changing structures and internal dynamics, and provides an intuitive base for future controls work. This paper also presents two physical SMA based cellular actuator arrays which validate the presented theory and give a basis for future development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in fire frequencies across two land-use gradients reveal that fire-free land-management can substantially reduce fire incidence by as much as 69{\%}. If sustainable fire-free land-management of deforested areas is not adopted in the REDD mechanism, then the carbon savings achieved by avoiding deforestation may be partially negated by increased emissions from fires.},

By using hydrogel scaffolds and muscle tissue, soft biological robotic actuators that are capable of motility have been successfully engineered with varying morphologies. Having the flexibility of altering geometry while ensuring tissue viability can enable advancing functional output from these machines through the implementation of new construction concepts and fabrication approaches. This study reports a forward engineering approach to computationally design the next generation of biological machines via direct numerical simulations. This was subsequently followed by fabrication and characterization of high force producing biological machines. These biological machines show millinewton forces capable of driving locomotion at speeds above 0.5 mm s−1. It is important to note that these results are predicted by computational simulations, ultimately showing excellent agreement of the predictive models and experimental results, further providing the ability to forward design future generations of these biological machines.

abstract = {Pectoral fins fascinate researchers for their important role in fish maneuvers. By possessing a complicated flexible structure with several fin rays made by a thin film, the fin exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) motion. The complex 3D fin kinematics makes it challenging to study the performance of pectoral fin. Nevertheless, a detailed study on the 3D motion pattern of pectoral fins is necessary to the design and control of a bio-inspired fin rays. Therefore, a highspeed photography system is introduced in this paper to study the 3D motion of a Koi Carp by analyzing the two views of its pectoral fin simultaneously. The key motions of the pectoral fins are first captured in both hovering and retreating. Next, the 3D configuration of the pectoral fins is reconstructed by digital image processing, in which the movement of fin rays during fish retreating and hovering is obtained. Furthermore, the method of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is adopted to extract the basic motion patterns of pectoral fins from extensive image sequences, i.e. expansion, bending, cupping, and undulation. It is believed that the movement of the fin rays and the basic patterns of the pectoral fins obtained in the present work can provide a good foundation for the development and control of bionic flexible pectoral fins for underwater propeller. {\textcopyright}2013 Jilin University.},

Bioprinting can be used to precisely position cells and cell-laden materials to generate controlled tissue architecture. Therefore, it represents an exciting alternative for organ fabrication. Despite the rapid progress in the field, the development of printing processes that can be used to fabricate macroscale tissue constructs from ECM-derived hydrogels has remained a challenge. Here we report a strategy for bioprinting of photolabile cell-laden methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) hydrogels. We bioprinted cell-laden GelMA at concentrations ranging from 7 to 15{\%} with varying cell densities and found a direct correlation between printability and the hydrogel mechanical properties. Furthermore, encapsulated HepG2 cells preserved cell viability for at least eight days following the bioprinting process. In summary, this work presents a strategy for direct-write bioprinting of a cell-laden photolabile ECM-derived hydrogel, which may find widespread application for tissue engineering, organ printing and the development of 3D drug discovery platforms.},

abstract = {Changes in normalized cell length (NCL) and tissue volume densities (V(v)) of live trap tissues were studied during reopening of fully classed traps of Venus's flytrap (Dionaea muscipula Ellis). Four trap reopening stages were identified based on morphological changes observed in time lapse video: (1) Sealed-the last stage of trap closure before the trap began to reopen; (2) Deappressed-characterized by a convex bulge in the upper region of the trap; (3) Release-in which the bulge region moved closer to the trap margins initiating lobe sepamation while the marginal tynes remained interdigitated; (4) Fully opened-the trap lobes assumed a morphology similar to that of a nonstimulated trap. Morphological changes associated with trap reopening occurred as a series of relatively fast (1-5h) and slow (10-15 h) movements and appeared to be a reversal of the morphologies observed during trap closure. However, comparison of changes in NCL of trap tissues during closure and reopening showed very little statistical correlation indicating that the tissue dynamics associated with trap closure were not simply reversed during reopening. Although the precise cell movements that provided driving force for trap morphological change were not delineated in this study, comparison of NCL data suggested that tissues in the trap lobe were alternately 'active' and 'quiescent' in temporally and regionally complex patterns. Changes in the NCL of analogous tissues on opposite sides of the mid-trap tissues within a trap region showed high positive correlation values, which indicated the possibility of coordinated activity in opposing tissues.},

abstract = {This letter addresses the kinematic modeling and control of hyper-redundant robots inspired by the octopus arm. We propose a discrete multi-segment model in which each segment is a 6-DoF Gough-Stewart parallel platform. Our model is novel in that it can reproduce all generic motions of an octopus arm, including elongation, shortening, bending, and particularly twisting, which is usually not included in such models, while enforcing the constant-volume property of the octopus arm. We use an approach that is inspired by the unique decentralized nervous system of the octopus arm to overcome challenges in solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem, including the large number of solutions for this problem and the impracticality of numerical methods for real-time applications. We apply the pseudo-inverse Jacobian method to design a kinematic controller that drives the tip of the hyper-redundant robot to track a reference trajectory. We evaluate our proposed model and controller in simulation for a variety of 3D reference trajectories: a straight line, an ellipse, a sinusoidal path, and trajectories that emulate octopus-like reaching and fetching movements. The tip of the simulated hyper-redundant robot tracks the reference trajectories with average root-mean-square errors that are less than 0.3{\%} of the robot's initial length, demonstrating the effectiveness of our modeling and control approaches.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges in the development of microrobots, i.e. robots at the sub-millimeter scale, is the difficulty of adopting traditional solutions for power, control and, especially, actuation. As a result, most current microrobots are directly manipulated by external fields, and possess only a few passive degrees of freedom (DOFs). We have reported a strategy that enables embodiment, remote powering and control of a large number of DOFs in mobile soft microrobots. These consist of photo-responsive materials, such that the actuation of their soft continuous body can be selectively and dynamically controlled by structured light fields. Here we use finite-element modelling to evaluate the effective number of DOFs that are addressable in our microrobots. We also demonstrate that by this flexible approach different actuation patterns can be obtained, and thus different locomotion performances can be achieved within the very same microrobot. The reported results confirm the versatility of the proposed approach, which allows for easy application-specific optimization and online reconfiguration of the microrobot's behavior. Such versatility will enable advanced applications of robotics and automation at the micro scale.},

In this innovation, fluid-filled tubular cells are synthesized by integrating different Miura-Ori sheets into a three-dimensional topological system, where the internal pressures are strategically controlled similar to the motor cells in plants. Fluidic origami incorporates two crucial physiological features observed in nature: one is distributed, pressurized cellular organization, and the other is embedded multi-stability. For a single fluidic origami cell, two stable folding configurations can coexist due to the nonlinear relationships among folding, crease material deformation and internal volume change. When multiple origami cells are integrated, additional multi-stability characteristics could occur via the interactions between pressurized cells. Changes in the fluid pressure can tailor the existence and shapes of these stable folding configurations. As a result, fluidic origami can switch between being mono-stable, bistable and multi-stable with pressure control, and provide a rapid  snap-through' type of shape change based on the similar principles as in plants. The outcomes of this research could lead to the development of new adaptive materials or structures, and provide insights for future plant physiology studies at the cellular level.},

From artificial requirements to innovative technological solutions View the table of contents for this issue, or go to the journal homepage for more 2012 Bioinspir. Biomim. 7 025005 Abstract Soft robotics is a current focus in robotics research because of the expected capability of soft robots to better interact with real-world environments. As a point of inspiration in the development of innovative technologies in soft robotics, octopuses are particularly interesting 'animal models'. Octopus arms have unique biomechanical capabilities that combine significant pliability with the ability to exert a great deal of force, because they lack rigid structures but can change and control their degree of stiffness. The octopus arm motor capability is a result of the peculiar arrangement of its muscles and the properties of its tissues. These special abilities have been investigated by the authors in a specific study dedicated to identifying the key principles underlying these biological functions and deriving engineering requirements for robotics solutions. This paper, which is the second in a two-part series, presents how the identified requirements can be used to create innovative technological solutions, such as soft materials, mechanisms and actuators. Experiments indicate the ability of these proposed solutions to ensure the same performance as in the biological model in terms of compliance, elongation and force. These results represent useful and relevant components of innovative soft-robotic systems and suggest their potential use to create a new generation of highly dexterous, soft-bodied robots.

In order to ease their translation towards real biomedical applications, simpler designs as well as cheaper yet more reliable materials and fabrication processes should be adopted, provided that the functionality of the microrobots can be kept. A simple single-hinge design could already enable microswimming in non-Newtonian fluids, which most bodily fluids are. Here, we address the fabrication of such single-hinge microrobots with a 3D-printed soft material. Firstly, a finite element model is developed to investigate the deformability of the 3D-printed microstructure under typical values of the actuating magnetic fields. Then the microstructures are fabricated by direct 3D-printing of a soft material and their swimming performances are evaluated. The speeds achieved with the 3D-printed microrobots are comparable to those obtained in previous work with complex fabrication procedures, thus showing great promise for 3D-printed microrobots to be operated in biological fluids.},

abstract = {The myofilament protein compositions of muscle fibres from the transverse muscle mass of the tentacles and the transverse muscle mass of the arms of the loliginid squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana were compared. These two muscle masses are distinct types, differing in their ultrastructural and behavioural properties. The transverse muscle of the tentacles consists of specialized muscle fibres that exhibit cross-striation and unusually short sarcomeres and thick filaments. The transverse muscle of the arms consists of obliquely striated muscle fibres that are typical of cephalopod skeletal muscle in general. The specialization of the tentacle muscle results in a high shortening speed and reflects its role in creating rapid elongation of the tentacles during prey capture. Comparison of samples of myofilament preparations of the two muscle fibre types using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and peptide mapping of myosin heavy chains from the two muscle fibre types, however, showed little evidence of differences in contractile protein isoforms. Thus, specialization for high shortening speed appears to have occurred primarily through changes in the dimensions and arrangement of the myofilament lattice, rather than through changes in biochemistry. The thick filament core protein paramyosin was tentatively identified in the squid muscle fibres. This protein was less abundant in the short thick filament cross-striated tentacle muscle cells than in the obliquely striated arm cells.},

abstract = {Soft robots possess many attributes that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with conventional robots composed of rigid materials. Yet, despite recent advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and power sources. New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic11 that autonomously regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation. The body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique. The fluidic and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale. Our integrated design and rapid fabrication approach enables the programmable assembly of multiple materials within this architecture, laying the foundation for completely soft, autonomous robots.},

abstract = {Pectoral fins fascinate researchers for their important role in fish maneuvers. By possessing a complicated flexible structure with several fin rays made by a thin film, the fin exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) motion. The complex 3D fin kinematics makes it challenging to study the performance of pectoral fin. Nevertheless, a detailed study on the 3D motion pattern of pectoral fins is necessary to the design and control of a bio-inspired fin rays. Therefore, a highspeed photography system is introduced in this paper to study the 3D motion of a Koi Carp by analyzing the two views of its pectoral fin simultaneously. The key motions of the pectoral fins are first captured in both hovering and retreating. Next, the 3D configuration of the pectoral fins is reconstructed by digital image processing, in which the movement of fin rays during fish retreating and hovering is obtained. Furthermore, the method of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is adopted to extract the basic motion patterns of pectoral fins from extensive image sequences, i.e. expansion, bending, cupping, and undulation. It is believed that the movement of the fin rays and the basic patterns of the pectoral fins obtained in the present work can provide a good foundation for the development and control of bionic flexible pectoral fins for underwater propeller. {\textcopyright} 2013 Jilin University.},

There are benefits to be had in folding compliant sheets (which cannot self-guide their motion) rather than conventional rigid origami. Example applications include scaffolds for artificial tissue generation and foldable substrates for flexible electronic assemblies. Highly compliant origami has not been contemplated by existing theory, which treats origami structures largely as rigid or semirigid mechanisms with compliant hinges- "mechanism-reliant origami." We present a quantitative metric-the origami compliance metric (OCM)-that aids in identifying proper modeling of a homogeneous origami structure based upon the compliance regime it falls into (soft, hybrid, or mechanism-reliant). We discuss the unique properties, applications, and design drivers for practical implementation of Soft Origami. We detail a theory of proper constraint by which an ideal soft structure's number of degrees-of-freedom may be approximated as 3n, where n is the number of vertices of the fold pattern. Buckling and sagging behaviors in very compliant structures can be counteracted with the application of tension; we present a method for calculating the tension force required to reduce sagging error below a user-prescribed value. Finally, we introduce a concept for a scalable process in which a few actuators and stretching membranes may be used to simultaneously fold many origami substructures that share common degrees-of-freedom.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, evidence accumulated by several groups of independent investigators suggested that there were at least two species of octopuses referred to in literature accounts as Octopus joubini Robson, 1929. Since Robson's (1929) original description of the gravid, female holotype collected at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, virtually the entire body of literature on the systematics, biology and life history of O. joubini has incorporated specimens collected from two shallow water Florida localities: Biscayne Bay and St. Joseph Bay. Both populations produce large eggs (6-8 mm long) and benthic hatchlings. The second pygmy species produces small eggs (2-5 mm long) and planktonic hatchlings. Based on examination of ovarian eggs from the holotype of O. joubini Robson, 1929, it has been detennined that the small egg form, not the large egg foim of the western Atlantic Ocean pygmy octopus, supports the name O. joubini. Octopus mercatoris Adam, 1937, is also referable to this complex but it is not now known whether it is conspecific with the large or small egg pygmy octopus or represents a third species in this complex. If not conspecific with O. mercatoris, the common, large egg species is undescribed. The first observations on the life history and biology of the "true" Octopus joubini were obtained from live animals collected south of Galveston, Texas and cultured in the laboratory. The species produces small eggs (2.3-4.8 mm long) that are attached individually to surrounding substrate. Maximum fecundity is 2,400 eggs and development requires approximately 35 days at 25°C. In all broods observed, the female deposits eggs over a minimum of 4 weeks resulting in all or most developmental stages being present by the time the first laid eggs complete their development. The planktonic hatchlings are 2.0-2.5 mm mantle length and have approximately 420 chromatophores. Two hatchlings were cultured through the planktonic stage to settlement in 21 days. Life span is temperature dependent and estimated to range from 6-12 months.},

abstract = {Exceptionally large strains can be produced in soft elastomers by the application of an electric field and the strains can be exploited for a variety of novel actuators, such as tunable lenses and tactile actuators. However, shape morphing with dielectric elastomers has not been possible since no generalizable method for changing their Gaussian curvature has been devised. Here it is shown that this fundamental limitation can be lifted by introducing internal, spatially varying electric fields through a layer-by-layer fabrication method incorporating shaped, carbon-nanotubes-based electrodes between thin elastomer sheets. To illustrate the potential of the method, voltage-tunable negative and positive Gaussian curvatures shapes are produced. Furthermore, by applying voltages to different sets of internal electrodes, the shapes can be re-configured. All the shape changes are reversible when the voltage is removed.},

abstract = {We study an efficient ad hoc multicast communication protocol for next-generation large-scale distributed cyber-physical systems that we dub Computational Robotic Materials (CRMs). CRMs tightly integrate sensing, actuation, computation and communication, and can enable materials that can change their shape, appearance and function in response to local sensing and distributed information processing. As CRMs potentially consist of thousands of nodes with limited processing power and memory, communication in such systems poses serious challenges. For example, when processing a gesture recorded by the CRM, only a subset of nodes involved in its detection should communicate amongst themselves for distributed proessing. In previous work, we proposed a Bloom filter-based approach to label the multicast group with an approximate error-resilient multicast tag that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of the sensor group. A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. We describe our Bloom filter-based multicast communication (BMC) protocol, and report experimental results using a 48-node Computational Robotic Material test-bed engaged in shape and gesture recognition.},

abstract = {This paper proposes three design concepts for developing a crawling robot inspired by an inchworm, called the Omegabot. First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Origami is a topic of rapidly growing interest in both the scientific and engi- neering research communities due to its promising potential in a broad range of applications. Previous assembly approaches for origami structures at the micro/nanoscale are constrained by the applicable classes of materials, topol- ogies, and/or capability for reversible control over the transformation process. Here, a strategy is introduced that exploits mechanical buckling for auto- nomic origami assembly of 3D structures across material classes from soft polymers to brittle inorganic semiconductors, and length scales from nanom- eters to centimeters. This approach relies on a spatial variation of thickness in the initial 2D structures as a means to produce engineered folding creases during the compressive buckling process. The elastic nature of the assembly scheme enables active, deterministic control over intermediate states in the 2D to 3D transformation in a continuous and reversible manner. Demonstra- tions include a broad set of 3D structures formed through unidirectional, bidirectional, and even hierarchical folding, with examples ranging from half cylindrical columns and fish scales, to cubic boxes, pyramids, starfish, paper fans, skew tooth structures, and to amusing system-level examples of soccer balls, model houses, cars, and multifloor textured buildings.},

This study takes inspirations from biological world to practical control algorithms. In detail, an iterative learning scheme based control is studied with the cooperation of a filter to reduce the measurement noise, and a curve fitting component to keep the necessary phase difference between neighboring fin rays. Moreover, the iterative learning control algorithm is designed and implemented for practical applications. The experimental results validate that the proposed learning control can effectively improve the propulsion of RoboGnilos. For instance, the steady propulsion velocity may be enhanced by over 40{\%} with some specified parameters. ?? 2010 Jilin University.},

Pore sizes and distribution are compared and resulting hydrogel properties like swelling ratio, resistance towards external stimuli and enzymatic degradation were investigated. Porous hydrogels were functionalized and two cancer cell lines were successfully adhered onto the material. With simple methods, pores with a radius between 10 and 80 $\mu$m and channels of 25 $\mu$m radius with a length of several hundreds of $\mu$m could be created and analyzed with laser scanning confocal microscopy and electron microscopy respectively. Furthermore, the influence of different methods on swelling ratio, enzymatic degradation and pH and temperature resistance was observed.},

abstract = {A new type of flexible microactuator (FMA) has been developed for use in miniature robots. They are constructed using fiber-reinforced rubber and are actuated by an electropneumatic or electrohydraulic system. These microactuators have many degrees of freedom (including pitch, yaw, and stretch), making them suitable for robotic mechanisms such as arms, legs, or fingers. Pliant miniature robots can be created by combining FMAs. One example is a robot arm a few millimeters in diameter with seven degrees of freedom. The basic characteristics of the FMAs have been analyzed theoretically and experimentally. It is noted that, since the statistics and dynamics are predicted easily, FMAs can be designed efficiently.},

abstract = {A need exists for artificial muscles that are silent, soft, and compliant, with performance characteristics similar to those of skeletal muscle, enabling natural interaction of assistive devices with humans. By combining one of humankind's oldest technologies, textile processing, with electroactive polymers, we demonstrate here the feasibility of wearable, soft artificial muscles made by weaving and knitting, with tunable force and strain. These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices.},

One of the primary difficulties with deformable robots is that they have conceptually infinite degrees of freedom. We solve this problem through the selection of an essential point to generate a desired motion. The problem is then reduced to trajectory control of a point on the robot. We have proposed dynamic models of electro-active polymers system and derived a variety of motions by applying either spatially or time varying electric fields. However, the motion control problem has not yet been investigated. We show a procedure to realize an inversion (turning over) motion of a starfish-shaped gel robots by applying both spatially varying and time alternating electric fields. This work takes the first step towards motion control of deformable robots.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel shape morphing scheme enabled by a new artificial muscle: twisted and coiled actuators (TCAs). This new actuator is purely soft, low cost, and electrically driven. Embedding a TCA and a thermoplastic material with variable stiffness into soft materials, we create a miniature shape-morphing link. We also establish a general model to predict the steady-state shape of the link given an input power applied to the TCA. Experiments are conducted to characterize parameters and verify the proposed model. Finally, we demonstrate this shape-morphing link can serve as a link in a mechanism to change the trajectory of its foot or endpoint. We envision that such a new shape-morphing scheme can enable robots to leverage the same mechanical design for different functions.},

abstract = {Using strong fibers to reinforce a hydrogel is highly desirable but difficult. Such a composite would combine the attributes of a solid that provides strength and a liquid that transports matter. Most hydrogels, however, are brittle, allowing the fibers to cut through the hydrogel when the composite is loaded. Here we circumvent this problem by using a recently developed tough hydrogel. We fabricate a composite using an alginate-polyacrylamide hydrogel reinforced with a random network of stainless steel fibers. Because the hydrogel is tough, the composite does not fail by the fibers cutting the hydrogel; instead, it fails by the fibers pulling out of the hydrogel against friction. Both stiffness and strength can be increased significantly by adding fibers to the hydrogel. Before failure the composite dissipates a significant amount of energy, at a tunable level of stress, attaining large deformation. Potential applications of tough hydrogel composites include energy-absorbing helmets, tendon repair surgery, and stretchable biometric sensors.},

abstract = {We present an untethered, electrostatic, MEMS micro-robot, with dimensions of 60 {\&}mu;m by 250 {\&}mu;m by 10 {\&}mu;m. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7{\&}deg;/mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 {\&}mu;m, and achieve speeds of over 200 {\&}mu;m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium, which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-{\&}mu;m microfabricated electrodes, arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-{\&}mu;m spaces. The electrodes are insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Hysteresis in the system allows on-board storage of n=2 bits of state information in response to these electrical signals. The presence of on-board state information within the device itself allows each of the two device subsystems (USDA and steering arm) to be individually addressed and controlled- . We describe this communication and control strategy and show necessary and sufficient conditions for voltage-selective actuation of all 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}n{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} system states, both for our devices (n=2), and for the more general case (where n is larger.).},

abstract = {Inspired by the shape deformations of plants with inhomogeneous structures, more and more attention has been paid to prepare deformable actuators with inhomogeneous structures and precisely program their shape deformations. Here, we report a simple and novel method to prepare graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide (GO/RGO) nanocomposite hydrogel-based deformable actuators by local electrochemical reduction of homogeneous poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/GO (PNIPAM/GO) hydrogels. GO nanosheets in PNIPAM/GO hydrogels can be reduced in an electrolytic cell made of two indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass plates, and local reduction can be realized by pasting patterned insulating stickers onto the cathodal ITO glass plate. The reduction of GO nanosheets leads to the breakage of hydrogen bonding between GO nanosheets and PNIPAM chains and hence lower cross-linking densities of the reduced regions. Therefore, the difference in the swelling/deswelling behaviors between the reduced and unreduced sides (or regions) enables the shape deformations of the PNIPAM/GO hydrogels, and their deformation degrees can be adjusted by changing their composition and thickness as well as the parameters of electrochemical reduction (e.g., applied voltage and reduction time). Very impressively, shape deformations from one-dimensional (1D) to two-dimensional (2D) and 2D to three-dimensional (3D) can be programmed by appropriate designing reduced regions on 1D hydrogel strips or 2D hydrogel sheets. As a representative example, a 3D "scorpion" with uplifted head/tail and an arched belly could deform from a 2D "scorpion" with the reduced head/tail on the same side and the reduced belly on the opposite side.},

So far, a conventional robot cannot mimic this complexity even remotely. Classical robots are often used to help with lifting and gripping and thus to alleviate the effects of menial tasks. Sensors can render robots responsive, and artificial intelligence aims at enabling autonomous responses. Inanimate soft robots are a step in this direction, but it will only be in combination with living systems that full complexity will be achievable. The field of biohybrid soft robotics provides entirely new concepts to address current challenges, for example the ability to self-heal, enable a soft touch, or to show situational versatility. Therefore, “living materials” are at the heart of this review. Similarly to biological taxonomy, there is a recent effort for taxonomy of biohybrid soft robotics. Here, an expansion is proposed to take into account not only function and origin of biohybrid soft robotic components, but also the materials. This materials taxonomy key demonstrates visually that materials science will drive the development of the field of soft biohybrid robotics.},

Therefore, the combination of both provides endless possibilities for tasks, such as espionage, pollution and marine wildlife surveillance, and border protection. Applying bioinspiration and biomimetics not only camouflages the robot, but also increases the efficiency of already perfected designs. Because bioinspiration and aerial-aquatic locomotion are the main attraction for this article, this review gathers the characteristics of aerial-aquatic animals useful for such designs. These animals are diving birds and flying fish, specifically plunge-diving birds, surface-diving birds, both plunge- and surface-diving birds, two-winger flying fish, and four-winger flying fish. The overview of the current marine bioinspired and non-bioinspired robots that are both aerial and aquatic are also presented, followed by the limitations and recommendations of the bioinspired robots. It is shown by a comparison between the bioinspired robot and its corresponding animal that the existing robotic systems are not truly bioinspired. The main traits these systems are missing are replicating the exact weight, size, muscle movement, and skin texture of the biological animal. In order to have efficient robots, bioinspiration needs to be perfected. Doing so requires not only the basic design to be replicated, but every detail of the system to be imitated.},

The wide spread of soft robotics relies on numerous investigations of diverse materials and technologies for actuation and sensing, and on research of control tech ­ niques, all of which can serve the purpose of building robots with high deformability and compliance. But the core challenge of soft robotics research is, in fact, the variability and controllability of such deformability and compliance. In nature, there are some examples of soft structures with variable stiffness: the octopus is able to selectively stiffen parts of its arms to use them as a modifiable skele­ ton, and the squid with its tentacles and the elephant with its trunk can do the same to transmit very high forces. Tongues in general and human lips are other examples. Stiffness tuning is the way soft structures (natural or artifi­ cial) can effectively interact with the environment. Inher­ ent softness enables dexterity and safe interactions (preventing damage to the environment and to the entity), but stiffening is required to increase the forces transferred to the environment when necessary. Thus, this has to be done on demand and possibly without deformation. This article reviews the approaches for on­demand stiffening obtained through direct activation of soft actu­ ation technologies, which are being explored for soft robotics. We exclude from this review the stiffness change},

This form of locomotion is particularly effective in constrained spaces, and although the motion has been understood for some time, it has rarely been effectively or accurately implemented in a robotic platform. We present a technique using a braided mesh exterior to produce smooth waves of motion along the body of a worm-like robot. We also present a new analytical model of this motion and compare predicted robot velocity to a 2-D simulation and a working prototype. Because constant-velocity peristaltic waves form due to accelerating and decelerating segments, it has been often assumed that this motion requires strong anisotropic ground friction. However, our analysis shows that with uniform, constant velocity waves, the forces that cause accelerations within the body sum to zero. Instead, transition timing between aerial and ground phases plays a critical role in the amount of slippage, and the final robot speed. The concept is highly scalable, and we present methods of construction at two different scales},

abstract = {A series of temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) hydrogels with large pore size and fast response were prepared by carrying out polymerizations in aqueous sodium chloride solutions with different concentrations. In comparison with conventional PNIPA hydrogels, the PNIPA gels thus prepared have remarkably larger swelling ratios below their lower critical solution temperature (LCST), and exhibit much faster response rates as the temperature is raised above their LCST. The improved properties are due to the presence of inorganic salt, NaCl, which leads the phase separation and formation of a heterogeneous porous structure during the polymerizations. The study on the drug release properties shows the macroporous hydrogels exhibit modulated release in response to temperature. The model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), can be released completely from the porous hydrogels at the temperature lower than the LCST because the pore size of the hydrogels is larger than the protein molecules. However, the release of BSA from the gels almost stops after a "burst" release in the initial stage at the temperature higher than the LCST because the pores are closed at the high temperature. {\textcopyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Rather than combining these functions as an afterthought, we design sensors and actuators into the robot at the onset, both reducing fabrication complexity and optimizing component interactions. We utilize liquid metal strain sensors and pneumatic actuators embedded into a silicone robotic gripper. The robot's body is formed by curing the silicone in complex 3D printed molds. We show that the liquid metal strain gauges provide a repeatable resistance response during robotic actuation. We further show that, given sufficient control over other time-dependent variables, it is possible to determine when the robot begins gripping an object during actuation.},

abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in polymeric materials, which alter shape upon external stimuli, suggesting potential applications in robotics, biomedical engineering, and optical devices. These stimuli-responsive materials may be categorized into two classes: (i) shape-changing materials in which a specific type of shape-shifting is encoded in the original material structure and (ii) shape-memory materials, which do not possess any predetermined shape-shifting as prepared, yet allow programming of complex shape transformations on demand. While shape alterations in shape-changing materials are intrinsically reversible, shape memory is usually a one-way transformation from a metastable (programmed) to an equilibrium (original) state. Recently, different principles for both one-way reversible and two-way reversible shape memory have been developed. These offer a powerful combination of reversibility and programmability, which significantly expands the range of potential applications. The goal of this review is to highlight recent developments in reversible shape-shifting by introducing novel mechanisms, materials, and applications.},

The development of electronic networks comprised of flexible, stretchable, and robust devices that are compatible with large-area implementation and integrated with multiple functionalities is a testament to the progress in developing an electronic skin (e-skin) akin to human skin. E-skins are already capable of providing augmented performance over their organic counterpart, both in superior spatial resolution and thermal sensitivity. They could be further improved through the incorporation of additional functionalities (e.g., chemical and biological sensing) and desired properties (e.g., biodegradability and self-powering). Continued rapid progress in this area is promising for the development of a fully integrated e-skin in the near future.},

Because of their biocompatibility and similarities to native extracellular matrix, hydrogels have emerged as leading candidates for engineered tissue scaffolds. However, precise control of hydrogel properties, such as porosity, remains a challenge. Traditional techniques for creating bulk porosity in polymers have demonstrated success in hydrogels for tissue engineering; however, often the conditions are incompatible with direct cell encapsulation. Emerging technologies have demonstrated the ability to control porosity and the microarchitectural features in hydrogels, creating engineered tissues with structure and function similar to native tissues. In this review, we explore the various technologies for controlling the porosity and microarchitecture within hydrogels, and demonstrate successful applications of combining these techniques. {\textcopyright} 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

This is the case for the light-driven microrobots based on liquid-crystal elastomers (LCEs). Here we show that the soft microrobots can move through an agarose hydrogel by means of light-controlled travelling-wave motions. This is achieved by exploiting the inherent rise of the LCE temperature above the melting temperature of the agarose gel, which facilitates penetration of the microrobot through the hydrogel. The locomotion performance is investigated as a function of the travelling-wave parameters, showing that effective propulsion can be obtained by adapting the generated motion to the specific environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Despite advantages and promising features of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC), this smart material has some drawbacks that should be eliminated as much as possible for improving the IPMC performance. One of the most important drawbacks is the back relaxation (BR). When a step input voltage is applied to the IPMC, it bends toward the anode. The BR is the unwanted and slow bending of the IPMC back toward the cathode. Several techniques based on using a feedback control loop have been proposed for eliminating the BR effect. However, these techniques are effective only when the bending displacement of the IPMC is small. In this paper, we propose a nonfeedback method for restraining the IPMC BR effect even in large bending displacement. The proposed technique is based on the fast reciprocating motions of free water molecules in Nafion membrane between the anode and the cathode. For this purpose, we have used a local Gaussian disturbance in a specifically patterned IPMC. We have described our idea conceptually and we have validated it by several experimental results.},

We have proposed dynamic models of electro- active polymen system and derived a variety of motions by applying either spatially or time varying electric fields. However, the motion control problem bas not yet been investigated.

Soft, flexible, and stretchable electronic devices provide a novel platform to interface with soft tissues for robotic feedback and control, regenerative medicine, and continuous health monitoring. Here, we introduce the term "lab-on-skin" to describe a set of electronic devices that have physical properties, such as thickness, thermal mass, elastic modulus, and water-vapor permeability, which resemble those of the skin. These devices can conformally laminate on the epidermis to mitigate motion artifacts and mismatches in mechanical properties created by conventional, rigid electronics while simultaneously providing accurate, non-invasive, long-term, and continuous health monitoring. Recent progress in the design and fabrication of soft sensors with more advanced capabilities and enhanced reliability suggest an impending translation of these devices from the research lab to clinical environments. Regarding these advances, the first part of this manuscript reviews materials, design strategies, and powering systems used in soft electronics. Next, the paper provides an overview of applications of these devices in cardiology, dermatology, electrophysiology, and sweat diagnostics, with an emphasis on how these systems may replace conventional clinical tools. The review concludes with an outlook on current challenges and opportunities for future research directions in wearable health monitoring.},

In addition, active materials, such as shape memory polymers, can be printed to create an active microstructure within a solid. These active materials can subsequently be activated in a controlled manner to change the shape or configuration of the solid in response to an environmental stimulus. This has been termed 4D printing, with the 4th dimension being the time-dependent shape change after the printing. In this paper, we advance the 4D printing concept to the design and fabrication of active origami, where a flat sheet automatically folds into a complicated 3D component. Here we print active composites with shape memory polymer fibers precisely printed in an elastomeric matrix and use them as intelligent active hinges to enable origami folding patterns. We develop a theoretical model to provide guidance in selecting design parameters such as fiber dimensions, hinge length, and programming strains and temperature. Using the model, we design and fabricate several active origami components that assemble from flat polymer sheets, including a box, a pyramid, and two origami airplanes. In addition, we directly print a 3D box with active composite hinges and program it to assume a temporary flat shape that subsequently recovers to the 3D box shape on demand.},

To achieve good performance, the lifting force is very important for a robot to be able to run on water. The loss of lifting force is associated with the rolling stability of the robot on water. The purpose of this study is to improve the rolling stability of a water-running robot through the periodic motion of a balancing tail. Kinematic analysis was performed to calculate the motions of the legs and the tail, and static analysis was performed to calculate the balancing effect of the tail motion. A numerical model was suggested to determine the dynamic performance of the robotic platform based on kinematic and static results. A simulation based on the numerical model was performed, and the results were compared with empirical data from a robot prototype. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data in terms of rolling stability The lifting force has only a slight effect. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for designing a stable water-running robot.},

abstract = {Living organisms have unique homeostatic abilities, maintaining tight control of their local environment through interconversions of chemical and mechanical energy and self-regulating feedback loops organized hierarchically across many length scales. In contrast, most synthetic materials are incapable of continuous self-monitoring and self-regulating behaviour owing to their limited single-directional chemomechanical or mechanochemical modes. Applying the concept of homeostasis to the design of autonomous materials would have substantial impacts in areas ranging from medical implants that help stabilize bodily functions to 'smart' materials that regulate energy usage. Here we present a versatile strategy for creating self-regulating, self-powered, homeostatic materials capable of precisely tailored chemo-mechano-chemical feedback loops on the nano-or microscale. We design a bilayer system with hydrogel-supported, catalyst-bearing microstructures, which are separated from a reactant-containing 'nutrient' layer. Reconfiguration of the gel in response to a stimulus induces the reversible actuation of the microstructures into and out of the nutrient layer, and serves as a highly precise 'on/off' switch for chemical reactions. We apply this design to trigger organic, inorganic and biochemical reactions that undergo reversible, repeatable cycles synchronized with the motion of the microstructures and the driving external chemical stimulus. By exploiting a continuous feedback loop between various exothermic catalytic reactions in the nutrient layer and the mechanical action of the temperature-responsive gel, we then create exemplary autonomous, self-sustained homeostatic systems that maintain a user-defined parameter-temperature-in a narrow range. The experimental results are validated using computational modelling that qualitatively captures the essential features of the self-regulating behaviour and provides additional criteria for the optimization of the homeostatic function, subsequently confirmed experimentally. This design is highly customizable owing to the broad choice of chemistries, tunable mechanics and its physical simplicity, and may lead to a variety of applications in autonomous systems with chemo-mechano-chemical transduction at their core. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Nature has abundant examples of soft muscular systems; examples of these in the human body are the stomach, tongue, diaphragm and heart. In fact, musculature has been deemed the “prototypical soft actuator” because it can achieve fast, strong actuation and remarkably complex patterns of movement. [1] Replication of these motions with traditional robotic systems is challenging, and involves complex mechanisms and many actuators. Furthermore, while the impedance of a robotic system can be modulated using force feedback and advanced control methods, it is diffi cult to achieve values similar to biological tissue. The emerging fi eld of “soft robotics” lends itself to replicating biomimetic motions, having simple and low cost actuation and the capability to achieve bending, twisting, extension and fl exion with non-rigid materials. However, complex motion often requires specifi cally designed actuators with multiple internal channels or complex cavities for actuation. [1–6] As depicted in Figure 1 a, if we look to biology for inspiration, complex motion in soft muscular structures is often achieved through the functional arrangement of many simple contractile elements arranged spatially in a soft matrix (Figure 1 b), and actuated synergistically.},

The basic idea is to embed a small virtual force and a small virtual impulse to the equation of motion, in order to avoid the drift typically experienced in constrained multibody simulations. The embedded correction terms are selected to minimally alter the dynamics in an acceleration and kinetic energy norm sense. The formulation allows one to use a standard ODE solver, avoiding the need for iterative constraint stabilization. The equation is based on the pseudoinverse of a constraint matrix such that it can be used under redundant constraints and kinematic singularities. The proposed method takes into account the finite word-length of the computational environment, and also accommodates possibly inconsistent initial conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By defining the optimal stiffness of the NFT in simulation, a fish robot prototype is then designed and fabricated. A series of experiments are performed to verify the proposed model. Experiment results are in good agreement with simulation data. The results show that the thrust and swimming speed of the fish robot are proportional to the amplitude of the driving moment. There are two resonant frequencies (f = 1.4 Hz and 2.2 Hz), the maximum thrust and swimming speed (about 0.7 BL{\textperiodcentered}s-1) are found to be around f = 1.4 Hz.

We demonstrate that a non-periodic cut pattern can make a sheet buckle into selectable three-dimensional shapes, such as domes or patterns of wrinkles, when pulled at specific boundary points. These global buckling modes are observed in experiments, predicted by numerical simulations, and rationalized by a kinematic analysis that highlights the role of the geometric frustration arising from non-periodicity. The study focuses initially on elastic sheets, and is later extended to sheets made of elastic-plastic materials, which can retain their shape upon load removal.},

We designed, fabricated, and tested prototype origami robots to address the canonical robotics challenges of mobility and manipulation, and subsequently combined these designs to generate a new, multifunctional machine.

Controlling the pressure inside the robot while at the same time controlling the tendons' displacements, the robot can be moved into a wide range of configurations while simultaneously controlling the arm's stiffness. This paper builds on earlier work by the authors: Here, we present a new conic-shaped manipulator structure and the control architecture. Using a constant curvature model, we have derived an approach suitable for controlling the robot manipulator. The manipulator's reachable workspace is analyzed and proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show the robot's stiffness control and motion abilities.},

abstract = {Motile plant structures (e.g., leaves, petals, cone scales, and capsules) are functionally highly robust and resilient concept generators for the development of biomimetic actuators for architecture. Here, a concise review of the state-of-the-art of plant movement principles and derived biomimetic devices is provided. Achieving complex and higher-dimensional shape changes and passive-hydraulic actuation at a considerable time scale, as well as mechanical robustness of the motile technical structures, is challenging. For example, almost all currently available bioinspired hydraulic actuators show similar limitations due to the poroelastic time scale. Therefore, a major challenge is increasing the system size to the meter range, with actuation times of minutes or below. This means that response speed and flow rate need significant improvement for the systems, and the long-term performance degradation issue of hygroscopic materials needs to be addressed. A theoretical concept for “escaping” the poroelastic regime is proposed, and the possibilities for enhancing the mechanical properties of passive-hydraulic bilayer actuators are discussed. Furthermore, the promising aspects for further studies to implement tropistic movement behavior are presented, i.e., movement that depends on the direction of the triggering stimulus, which can finally lead to “smart building skins” that autonomously and self-sufficiently react to changing environmental stimuli in a direction-dependent manner.},

Due to excellent flexibility and conductivity, liquid-metal soft sensors present high enhancement in sensitivity and precision, thus producing many profound applications. So far, a series of flexible and wearable sensors based on liquid metal have been designed and tested. Their applications have also witnessed a growing exploration in biomedical areas, including health-monitoring, electronic skin, wearable devices and intelligent robots etc. This article presents a systematic review of the typical progress of liquid metal-enabled soft sensors, including material innovations, fabrication strategies, fundamental principles, representative application examples, and so on. The perspectives of liquid-metal soft sensors is finally interpreted to conclude the future challenges and opportunities.},

abstract = {Exciting new robots are being developed that will operate in a different environment from traditional industrial factories or research laboratories. Researchers are working worldwide to create robots that are integrated into our daily lives. For the advancement of these new robots, compliant, safe, and new actuators are one of the important issues turning energy into safe motion. The biological counterpart is the muscle tendon structure that has functional performance characteristics and a neuromechanical control system that has far more superior capabilities. The superior power to weight ratio, force to weight ratio, and sensing characteristics limit the development of machines that can match motion, safety, and energy efficiency of a human or other animal. One of the key differences of biological systems is their adaptable compliance or variable stiffness compared with the traditional stiff electrical drives used for the standard industrial robotic applications, which require accurate, reference-trajectory tracking.More and more applications such as robots in close human or robot proximity, legged autonomous robots, and rehabilitation devices and prostheses demand a different set of design specifications, for which the use of compliant actuators can be beneficial as compared with the traditional stiff actuation schemes.},

The limited bending displacement produced by a lightweight piezocomposite actuator was amplified and transformed into a large tail beat motion by means of a linkage system. Caudal fins that mimic the shape of a mackerel fin were fabricated for the purpose of examining the effect of caudal fin characteristics on thrust production at an operating frequency range. The thickness distribution of a real mackerel's fin was measured and used to design artificial caudal fins. The thrust performance of the biomimetic fish robot propelled by fins of various thicknesses was examined in terms of the Strouhal number, the Froude number, the Reynolds number, and the power consumption. For the same fin area and aspect ratio, an artificial caudal fin with a distributed thickness shows the best forward speed and the least power consumption. ?? 2007 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Natural tissues possess a so-called J-shaped strain-stiffening behavior, being soft and compliant at small strains followed by a rapid stiffening at higher strains to prevent tissue damage. In addition, they have significant anisotropy and local variations of mechanical properties that are difficult to reproduce with homogeneous materials. Inspired by many biological organisms, biomimetic and soft robotics research has been focusing on composites of soft components being reinforced by structured stiff components. Especially, structures from mature textile technology and recently emerging additive manufacturing techniques are effective in achieving complex biomimetic structures in a deterministic manner. This review focuses on composites of soft elastomers and gels reinforced by woven or knitted fibers and 3D printed structures, often with conductive or magnetic functionalities for active actuation. Discussions include describing the property requirements from biomedical and soft robotics applications with examples of specific cases, followed by a summary of a few technical solutions that have been suggested. For soft matrix materials, we focus on silicone elastomers because they are the most widely used for biomedical and soft robotics applications. Among reinforcements, knitted/woven fabrics, kirigami/origami structures, and 3D printed metamaterial reinforcements are the topics of interest because their local and global structure can be designed to govern properties of the composites and direct complex motions of soft robots in a deterministic manner. Then, application examples in the fields of biomimetic materials, soft robotics, and tissue engineering are reviewed. Finally, we emphasize the importance of advancing numerical modeling and simulation tools to predict the mechanical properties and actuation behavior of the designed composite materials.},

abstract = {Soft materials are increasingly utilized for various purposes in many engineering applications. These materials have been shown to perform a number of functions that were previously difficult to implement using rigid materials. Here, we argue that the diverse dynamics generated by actuating soft materials can be effectively used for machine learning purposes. This is demonstrated using a soft silicone arm through a technique of multiplexing, which enables the rich transient dynamics of the soft materials to be fully exploited as a computational resource. The computational performance of the soft silicone arm is examined through two standard benchmark tasks. Results show that the soft arm compares well to or even outperforms conventional machine learning techniques under multiple conditions. We then demonstrate that this system can be used for the sensory time series prediction problem for the soft arm itself, which suggests its immediate applicability to a real-world machine learning problem. Our approach, on the one hand, represents a radical departure from traditional computational methods, whereas on the other hand, it fits nicely into a more general perspective of computation by way of exploiting the properties of physical materials in the real world.},

However, manufacturing of miniature polymeric actuators has been complicated owing to the necessity of including electrodes for actuation or using lithographic techniques for patterning. Here, we demonstrate that all-polymer microdevices can be fabricated using inkjet printing technology in combination with self-organizing liquid-crystal network actuators. We exploit the self-assembling properties of the liquid crystal to create large strain gradients, and light-driven actuation is chosen to allow simple and remote addressing. By using multiple inks, microactuators with different subunits are created that can be selectively addressed by changing the wavelength of the light. The actuators mimic the motion of natural cilia. These artificial cilia have the potential to create flow and mixing in wet environments such as lab-on-a-chip applications. The process is easily adapted for roll-to-roll fabrication, allowing for large-scale and low-cost production of miniaturized active polymer systems.},

Masked deposition eliminates the need for manual injection fi lling, which enables certain geometries that cannot be produced by injection and allows for the automated, high-volume production of Ga-In based “liquid-embedded elastomer electronics” (LE3).

abstract = {Certain proteins undergo a substantial conformational change in response to a given stimulus. This conformational change can manifest in different manners and result in an actuation, that is, catalytic or signalling event, movement, interaction with other proteins, and so on. In all cases, the sensing-actuation process of proteins is initiated by a recognition event that translates into a mechanical action. Thus, proteins are ideal components for designing new nanomaterials that are intelligent and can perform desired mechanical actions in response to target stimuli. A number of approaches have been undertaken to mimic nature's sensing-actuating process. We now report a new hybrid material that integrates genetically engineered proteins within hydrogels capable of producing a stimulus-responsive action mechanism. The mechanical effect is a result of an induced conformational change and binding affinities of the protein in response to a stimulus. The stimuli-responsive hydrogel exhibits three specific swelling stages in response to various ligands offering additional fine-tuned control over a conventional two-stage swelling hydrogel. The newly prepared material was used in the sensing, and subsequent gating and transport of biomolecules across a polymer network, demonstrating its potential application in microfluidics and miniaturized drug-delivery systems.},

Conductive hydrogels are a promising class of materials to design bioelectronics for new technological interfaces with human body, which are required to work for a long-term or under extreme environment. Traditional hydrogels are limited in short-term usage under room temperature, as it is difficult to retain water under cold or hot environment. Inspired by the antifreezing/antiheating behaviors from nature, and based on mussel chemistry, an adhesive and conductive hydrogel is developed with long-lasting moisture lock-in capability and extreme temperature tolerance, which is formed in a binary-solvent system composed of water and glycerol. Polydopamine (PDA)-decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are incorporated into the hydrogel, which assign conductivity to the hydrogel and serve as nanoreinforcements to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The catechol groups on PDA and viscous glycerol endow the hydrogel with high tissue adhesiveness. Particularly, the hydrogel is thermal tolerant to maintain all the properties under extreme wide tempreature spectrum (-20 or 60 °C) or stored for a long term. In summary, this mussel-inspired hydrogel is a promising material for self-adhesive bioelectronics to detect biosignals in cold or hot environments, and also as a dressing to protect skin from injuries related to frostbites or burns.},

abstract = {Living organisms use spatially controlled expansion and contraction of soft tissues to achieve complex three-dimensional (3D) morphologies and movements and thereby functions. However, replicating such features in man-made materials remains a challenge. Here we report an approach that encodes 2D hydrogels with spatially and temporally controlled growth (expansion and contraction) to create 3D structures with programmed morphologies and motions. This approach uses temperature-responsive hydrogels with locally programmable degrees and rates of swelling and shrinking. This method simultaneously prints multiple 3D structures with custom design from a single precursor in a one-step process within 60 s. We suggest simple yet versatile design rules for creating complex 3D structures and a theoretical model for predicting their motions. We reveal that the spatially nonuniform rates of swelling and shrinking of growth-induced 3D structures determine their dynamic shape changes. We demonstrate shape-morphing 3D structures with diverse morphologies, including bioinspired structures with programmed sequential motions.},

First, we discuss the use and control of biomolecules as nanoscale actuators. Molecular motors, such as DNA, kinesin, myosin, and F1-ATPase, have been shown to exert forces in the range between 1 pN to 45 pN. Second, we discuss the use and control of single and small clusters of cells to power microscale devices. Microorganisms, such as flagellated bacteria, protozoa, and algae, can naturally swim at speeds between 20 $\mu$m s-1 to 2 mm s-1 and produce thrust forces between 0.3 pN to 200 pN. Individual and clustered mammalian cells, such as cardiac and skeletal cells, can produce even higher contractile forces between 80 nN to 3.5 $\mu$N. Finally, we discuss the use and control of 2D- and 3D-assembled muscle tissues and muscle tissue explants as bioactuators to power devices. Depending on the size, composition, and organization of these hierarchical tissue constructs, contractile forces have been demonstrated to produce between 25 $\mu$N to 1.18 mN. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {All commercially available (as-received) perfluorinated ion-exchange polymers are in the form of hydrolyzed polymers and are semicrystalline and may contain ionic clusters. The membrane form of these polymers has a typical thickness in the range of approximately 100-300 $\mu$m. Such a thin thickness of commercially available membranes permits fast mass transfer for use in various chemical processes. Although ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscles made with these ion-exchange membranes have shown a great potential to produce large bending displacements in cantilever form and high force densities (maximum force greater than 40 times of its own weight), achieving large forces to be utilized in many practical devices requires manufacturing and fabrication of three-dimensional IPMCs. Knowing that such as-received semi-crystalline membranes are not melt-processable, they are not suitable for the fabrication of three-dimensional electroactive materials or other composite forms. In this work, the authors report a newly developed fabrication method that can scale-up or down the IPMC artificial muscles in a strip size of micro-to-centimeter thickness. We have adopted a recently developed technique by Moor et al. [J Membr Sci 75 (1992) 7] for dissolving as-received ion-exchange membranes in appropriate solvents. By carefully evaporating solvents out of the solution, recasted ion-exchange membranes were obtained. The test results showed that a successfully fabricated IPMC strip in a size of 2 mm thickness, 5 mm width, and 15 mm length, produces generative forces (tip forces) more than 20 gmf up to approximately a half centimeter-displacement under a small voltage. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Biomim. 7 025005 Abstract Soft robotics is a current focus in robotics research because of the expected capability of soft robots to better interact with real-world environments. As a point of inspiration in the development of innovative technologies in soft robotics, octopuses are particularly interesting 'animal models'. Octopus arms have unique biomechanical capabilities that combine significant pliability with the ability to exert a great deal of force, because they lack rigid structures but can change and control their degree of stiffness. The octopus arm motor capability is a result of the peculiar arrangement of its muscles and the properties of its tissues. These special abilities have been investigated by the authors in a specific study dedicated to identifying the key principles underlying these biological functions and deriving engineering requirements for robotics solutions. This paper, which is the second in a two-part series, presents how the identified requirements can be used to create innovative technological solutions, such as soft materials, mechanisms and actuators. Experiments indicate the ability of these proposed solutions to ensure the same performance as in the biological model in terms of compliance, elongation and force. These results represent useful and relevant components of innovative soft-robotic systems and suggest their potential use to create a new generation of highly dexterous, soft-bodied robots.

The translation of such design motifs into synthetic materials offers a spectrum of feasible pathways towards unprecedented properties and functionalities that are favorable for practical uses in a variety of engineering and medical fields. Here, we review the basic design forms and principles of naturally-occurring gradients in biological materials and discuss the functions and benefits that they confer to organisms. These gradients are fundamentally associated with the variations in local chemical compositions/constituents and structural characteristics involved in the arrangement, distribution, dimensions and orientations of the building units. The associated interfaces in biological materials invariably demonstrate localized gradients and a variety of gradients are generally integrated over multiple length-scales within the same material. The bioinspired design and applications of synthetic functionally graded materials that mimic their natural paradigms are revisited and the emerging processing techniques needed to replicate the biological gradients are described.

This article addresses the generation of large mechanical forces in muscle-like isometric actuator systems composed of stimuli-responsive nanocomposite hydrogels (NC gels) and aqueous NaCl solutions. NC gels with poly( N -isopropylacrylamide)–clay (PNIPA–clay) network structures exhibit high mechanical toughnesses and reversible swelling/deswelling behavior in the absence/presence of NaCl. NC gels constrained to constant lengths in brine generate enhanced contractive forces due to the salt-induced coil-to-globule transitions that are more than ten times larger than those induced thermally. A retractive tensile force (4 N/170 kPa), comparable to that of human muscle, was repeatedly generated at 20 °C using an appropriately composed NC gel (clay: 2 mol{\%}, PNIPA: 2 M), and by alternating the NaCl concentration between 0 and 5 M. This phenomenon is attributed to the combined effects of enhanced deswelling behavior resulting from the salt-induced coil-to-globule transition of PNIPA and the high stiffness of the deswollen gel due to the NaCl-strengthened PNIPA–clay network. },

abstract = {Gait disorders can be attributed to a variety of factors including aging, injury, and neurological disorders. A common disorder involves the ankle push-off phase of an individual's gait, which is vital to their ability to walk and propel themselves forward. During the ankle push-off stage, plantar flexor muscles are required to provide a large amount of torque to propel the heel off the ground, thus a condition that compromises the strength of these muscles can greatly affect one's walking ability. In order to rectify these issues, Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFO) are used to provide support to a user's ankle and assist with the force needed for heel off. This article introduces a robotic AFO which was developed with the intent of aiding during the heel-off stage. The proposed design utilizes the user's body weight to extend constant force springs positioned parallel to the calf to replicate the muscular force generated in plantar flexion. The extended spring is held in place using a ratcheting mechanism which is released with a solenoid during heel up. Similar research has been conducted in which assistive AFO's have been created, however little research has investigated the use of constant force springs in such devices. A healthy user tested the device on a treadmill and surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors were placed on the user's plantar flexor muscles to monitor potential reductions in muscular activity resulting from the assistance provided by the AFO device. The data demonstrates the robotic shoe was able to assist during the heel-off stage and reduced activation in the plantar flexor muscles was evident from the EMG data collected.},

Modulation of hydrogel pore structures is essential for tailoring their mechanical strength, response speeds, and motion behaviors. Conventional methods forming hydrogels with homogeneous or stepwise-distributed pore structures are limited by the required compromise to simultaneously optimize these aspects. Here, a heterobifunctional crosslinker enabled hydrothermal process is introduced to synthesize responsive hydrogels with well-defined gradient pore construction. According to gradient porosity controls, the hydrogels simultaneously exhibit rapid responses to external stimuli, high elasticity/compressibility, and programmable locomotion capability. By incorporating polypyrrole nanoparticles as photothermal transducers, photo/thermal responsive composite hydrogels are formed to enable programmable control of locomotion such as bending, curving, twisting, and octopus-like swimming under near-infrared laser stimulation. The tunable pore structures, mechanical properties, and locomotion of this new class of materials make these gradient porous hydrogels potentially suitable for a variety of applications.},

abstract = {Thermoresponsive, core - shell poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (p-NIPAm) nanoparticles (microgels) have been synthesized by seed and feed precipitation polymerization, and the influence of chemical differentiation between the core and shell polymers on the phase transition kinetics and thermodynamics has been examined. The results suggest that the core - shell architecture is a powerful one for the design of colloidal "smart gels" with tunable properties. To examine these materials, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 1H NMR, and temperature-programmed photon correlation spectroscopy (TP-PCS) have been employed. These measurements show that the addition of small concentrations of a hydrophobic monomer (butyl methacrylate, BMA) into the particle shell produces large decreases in the rate of thermo-induced particle collapse. Conversely, these low levels of hydrophobic modification do not perturb the thermodynamics of the particle phase transition. When these results are examined in light of previous studies of macroscopic hydrogels, they suggest that the formation of a thin, stable skin layer at the particle exterior during the early stages of particle collapse is the rate limiting factor in particle deswelling. Finally, the hydrophobicity (BMA content) of the shell determines the magnitude of the hydrogel collapse rate, while the thickness of the BMA containing region does not impact the observed kinetics. Together, these results suggest that control over the kinetics of microgel deswelling events can be accomplished simply by modification of the particle periphery, and therefore do not require homogeneous modification of the entire polymer structure.},

Employing this model, some benchmark homogeneous problems such as free, unidirectional constrained and biaxial constrained swelling as well as swelling of core-shell struc-tures are investigated. The main advantage of the model is its ability to solve inhomogeneous deformations due to a sta-ble behavior in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature. Therefore, inhomogeneous swelling of a spherical shell on a hard core with application to microfluidics is analytically and numerically investigated for various thicknesses of the shell. Based on the solved examples, it is shown that the model possesses continuity and stability in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature.},

abstract = {Evolutionary robotics is a promising approach to overcom- ing the limitations and biases of human designers in pro- ducing control strategies for autonomous robots. However, most work in evolutionary robotics remains solely concerned with optimizing control strategies for existing morphologies. By contrast, natural evolution, the only process that has pro- duced intelligent agents to date, may modify both the control (brain) and morphology (body) of organisms. Therefore, co- evolving morphology along with control may provide a better path towards realizing intelligent robots. This paper presents a novel method for co-evolving morphology and control us- ing CPPN-NEAT. This method is capable of dynamically ad- justing the resolution at which components of the robot are created: a large number of small sized components may be present in some body locations while a smaller number of larger sized components is present in other locations. Ad- vantages of this capability are demonstrated on a simple task, and implications for using this methodology to create more complex robots are discussed},

abstract = {Plants exhibit a variety of reversible motions, from the slow opening of pine cones to the impulsive closing of Venus flytrap leaves. These motions are achieved without muscles and they have inspired a wide spectrum of engineered materials and structures. This review summarizes the recent developments of plant-inspired adaptive structures and materials for morphing and actuation. We begin with a brief overview of the actuation strategies and physiological features associated to these plant movements, showing that different combinations of these strategies and features can lead to motions with different deformation characteristics and response speeds. Then we offer a comprehensive survey of the plant-inspired morphing and actuation systems, including pressurized cellular structures, osmotic actuation, anisotropic hygroscopic materials, and bistable systems for rapid movements. Although these engineered systems are vastly different in terms of their size scales and intended applications, their working principles are all related to the actuation strategies and physiological features in plants. This review is to promote future cross-disciplinary studies between plant biology and engineering, which can foster new solutions for many applications such as morphing airframes, soft robotics and kinetic architectures.},

abstract = {The usefulness and versatility of a robotic end-effector depends on the diversity of grasps it can accomplish and also on the complexity of the control methods required to achieve them. We believe that soft hands are able to provide diverse and robust grasping with low control complexity. They possess many mechanical degrees of freedom and are able to implement complex deformations. At the same time, due to the inherent compliance of soft materials, only very few of these mechani-cal degrees have to be controlled explicitly. Soft hands therefore may combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we present RBO Hand 2, a highly compliant, underactuated, robust, and dexterous anthropomorphic hand. The hand is inex-pensive to manufacture and the morphology can easily be adapted to specific applications. To enable efficient hand design, we derive and evaluate computational models for the mechanical properties of the hand's basic building blocks, called PneuFlex actuators. The versatility of RBO Hand 2 is evaluated by implementing the comprehensive Feix taxonomy of human grasps. The manipulator's capabilities and limits are demonstrated using the Kapandji test and grasping experi-ments with a variety of objects of varying weight. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effective dimensionality of grasp postures exceeds the dimensionality of the actuation signals, illustrating that complex grasping behavior can be achieved with relatively simple control.},

abstract = {All commercially available (as-received) perfluorinated ion-exchange polymers are in the form of hydrolyzed polymers and are semicrystalline and may contain ionic clusters. The membrane form of these polymers has a typical thickness in the range of approximately 100-300 {\$}\mu{\$}m. Such a thin thickness of commercially available membranes permits fast mass transfer for use in various chemical processes. Although ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscles made with these ion-exchange membranes have shown a great potential to produce large bending displacements in cantilever form and high force densities (maximum force greater than 40 times of its own weight), achieving large forces to be utilized in many practical devices requires manufacturing and fabrication of three-dimensional IPMCs. Knowing that such as-received semi-crystalline membranes are not melt-processable, they are not suitable for the fabrication of three-dimensional electroactive materials or other composite forms. In this work, the authors report a newly developed fabrication method that can scale-up or down the IPMC artificial muscles in a strip size of micro-to-centimeter thickness. We have adopted a recently developed technique by Moor et al. [J Membr Sci 75 (1992) 7] for dissolving as-received ion-exchange membranes in appropriate solvents. By carefully evaporating solvents out of the solution, recasted ion-exchange membranes were obtained. The test results showed that a successfully fabricated IPMC strip in a size of 2 mm thickness, 5 mm width, and 15 mm length, produces generative forces (tip forces) more than 20 gmf up to approximately a half centimeter-displacement under a small voltage. {\textcopyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, these porous actuators generally suffer from a lack of complexity and diversity in obtained 3D shapes. Herein, a simple yet versatile strategy is developed to generate shape-morphing hydrogels with both fast deformation and enhanced designability in 3D shapes by combining two promising technologies: electrospinning and 3D printing. Elaborate patterns are printed on mesostructured stimuli-responsive electrospun membranes, modulating in-plane and interlayer internal stresses induced by swelling/shrinkage mismatch, and thus guiding morphing behaviors of electrospun membranes to adapt to changes of the environment. With this strategy, a series of fast deformed hydrogel actuators are constructed with various distinctive responsive behaviors, including reversible/irreversible formations of 3D structures, folding of 3D tubes, and formations of 3D structures with multi low-energy states. It is worth noting that although poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) is chosen as the model system in the present research, our strategy is applicable to other stimuli-responsive hydrogels, which enriches designs of rapid deformed hydrogel actuators.},

abstract = {Responsive hydrogel actuators have promising applications in diverse fields. Most hydrogel actuators are limited by slow actuation or shape transformations. This work reports on snap-buckling motivated jumping of thermoresponsive hydrogel bilayers. The bilayers are composed of poly(NIPAM-co-DMAPMA)/clay hydrogel with different lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) in each layer, and thus undergoes slow reversible curling/uncurling at temperature changes. The gels are adhesive to numerous materials including aluminum. The adhesion between gels and an aluminum ratchet is utilized to constrain the thermoresponsive deformation of bilayers to store elastic energy. When the accumulated elastic energy overwhelms the gel-aluminum adhesion, snap-buckling takes place to abruptly release the accumulated energy, which motivates the bilayer to jump. The jumping direction, start time, height, and distance are controlled by the geometry of bilayers or the ratchet. This work paves a novel way for the rapid actuation of responsive hydrogels in a controlled manner and may stimulate the development of novel hydrogel devices.},

Such achievements are reviewed here in terms of the abilities that they provide robots that were not possible before. An analysis of the evolution of this field shows how, after a few pioneering works in the years 2009 to 2012, breakthrough results were obtained by taking seminal tech-nological and scientific challenges related to soft robotics from actuation and sensing to modeling and control. Further progress in soft robotics research has produced achievements that are important in terms of robot abilities—that is, from the viewpoint of what robots can do today thanks to the soft robotics approach. Abilities such as squeezing, stretching, climbing, growing, and morphing would not be possible with an approach based only on rigid links. The challenge ahead for soft robotics is to further develop the abilities for robots to grow, evolve, self-heal, develop, and biodegrade, which are the ways that robots can adapt their morphology to the environment.},

abstract = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a promising enabling technology for a wide range of emerging applications, including robotics, artificial muscles, and microfluidics. This is due to their large actuation strains, rapid response rate, low cost and low noise, high energy density, and high efficiency when compared with alternative actuators. These properties make DEAs ideal for the actuation of soft submersible devices, although their use has been limited because of three main challenges: (i) developing suitable, compliant electrode materials; (ii) the need to effectively insulate the actuator electrodes from the surrounding fluid; and (iii) the rigid frames typically required to prestrain the dielectric layers. We explored the use of a frameless, submersible DEA design that uses an internal chamber filled with liquid as one of the electrodes and the surrounding environmental liquid as the second electrode, thus simplifying the implementation of soft, actuated submersible devices. We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach with a prototype swimming robot composed of transparent bimorph actuator segments and inspired by transparent eel larvae, leptocephali. This design achieved undulatory swimming with a maximum forward swimming speed of 1.9 millimeters per second and a Froude efficiency of 52{\%}. We also demonstrated the capability for camouflage and display through the body of the robot, which has an average transmittance of 94{\%} across the visible spectrum, similar to a leptocephalus. These results suggest a potential for DEAs with fluid electrodes to serve as artificial muscles for quiet, translucent, swimming soft robots for applications including surveillance and the unobtrusive study of marine life.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the substantial element of reversibly actuating soft polymeric materials is chemical cross-linking, which is needed to provide elasticity required for the reversible actuation. On the example of melt spun and three-dimensional printed Janus fibers, we demonstrate here for the first time that cross-linking is not an obligatory prerequisite for reversible actuation of solid entangled polymers, since the entanglement network itself can build elasticity during crystallization. Indeed, we show that not-cross-linked polymers, which typically demonstrate plastic deformation in melt, possess enough elastic behavior to actuate reversibly. The Janus polymeric structure bends because of contraction of the polymer and due to entanglements and formation of nanocrystallites upon cooling. Actuation upon melting is simply due to relaxation of the stressed nonfusible component. This approach opens perspectives for design of solid active materials and actuator for robotics, biotechnology, and smart textile applications. The great advantage of our principle is that it allows design of non-cross-linked self-moving materials, which are able to actuate in both water and air, which are not cross-linked. We demonstrate application of actuating fibers for design of walkers, structures with switchable length, width, and thickness, which can be used for smart textile applications.},

abstract = {Conspectus The formation of well-defined and functional three-dimensional (3D) structures by buckling of thin sheets subjected to spatially nonuniform stresses is common in biological morphogenesis and has become a subject of great interest in synthetic systems, as such programmable shape-morphing materials hold promise in areas including drug delivery, biomedical devices, soft robotics, and biomimetic systems. Given their ability to undergo large changes in swelling in response to a wide variety of stimuli, hydrogels have naturally emerged as a key type of material in this field. Of particular interest are hybrid systems containing rigid inclusions that can define both the anisotropy and spatial nonuniformity of swelling as well as nanoparticulate additives that can enhance the responsiveness and functionality of the material. In this Account, we discuss recent progress in approaches to achieve well-defined shape morphing in hydrogel hybrids. First, we provide an overview of materials and methods that facilitate fabrication of such systems and outline the geometry and mechanics behind shape morphing of thin sheets. We then discuss how patterning of stiff inclusions within soft responsive hydrogels can be used to program both bending and swelling, thereby providing access to a wide array of complex 3D forms. The use of discretely patterned stiff regions to provide an effective composite response offers distinct advantages in terms of scalability and ease of fabrication compared with approaches based on smooth gradients within a single layer of responsive material. We discuss a number of recent advances wherein control of the mechanical properties and geometric characteristics of patterned stiff elements enables the formation of 3D shapes, including origami-inspired structures, concatenated helical frameworks, and surfaces with nonzero Gaussian curvature. Next, we outline how the inclusion of functional elements such as nanoparticles can enable unique pathways to programmable and even reprogrammable shape-morphing materials. We focus to a large extent on photothermally reprogrammable systems that include one of a variety of additives that serve to efficiently absorb light and convert it into heat, thereby driving the response of a temperature-sensitive hydrogel. Such systems are advantageous in that patterns of light can be defined with very high spatial and temporal resolution in addition to offering the potential for wavelength-selective addressability of multiple different inclusions. We highlight recent advances in the preparation of light-responsive hybrid systems capable of undergoing reprogrammable bending and buckling into well-defined 3D shapes. In addition, we describe several examples where shape tuning of hybrid systems enables control over the motion of responsive hydrogel-based materials. Finally, we offer our perspective on open challenges and future areas of interest for the field.},

abstract = {We present a coevolutionary algorithm for inferring the topology and parameters of a wide range of hidden nonlinear systems with a minimum of experimentation on the target system. The algorithm synthesizes an explicit model directly from the observed data produced by intelligently generated tests. The algorithm is composed of two coevolving populations. One population evolves candidate models that estimate the structure of the hidden system. The second population evolves informative tests that either extract new information from the hidden system or elicit desirable behavior from it. The fitness of candidate models is their ability to explain behavior of the target system observed in response to all tests carried out so far; the fitness of candidate tests is their ability to make the models disagree in their predictions. We demonstrate the generality of this estimation-exploration algorithm by applying it to four different problems—grammar induction, gene network inference, evolutionary robotics, and robot damage recovery—and discuss how it overcomes several of the pathologies commonly found in other coevolutionary algorithms. We show that the algorithm is able to successfully infer and/or manipulate highly nonlinear hidden systems using very few tests, and that the benefit of this approach increases as the hidden systems possess more degrees of freedom, or become more biased or unobservable. The algorithm provides a systematic method for posing synthesis or analysis tasks to a coevolutionary system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to modelling carangiform fish-like swimming motion for multi-joint robotic fish so that they can obtain fish-like behaviours and mimic the body motion of carangiform fish. A given body motion function of fish swimming is firstly converted to a tail motion function which describes the tail motion relative to the head. Then, the tail motion function is discretized into a series of tail postures over time. Thirdly, a digital approximation method calculates the turning angles of joints in the tail to approximate each tail posture; and finally, these angles are grouped into a look-up table, or regressed to a time-dependent function, for practically controlling the tail motors in a multi-joint robotic fish. The paper made three contributions: tail motion relative to the head, an error function for digital approximation and regressing a look-up table for online optimization. To prove the feasibility of the proposed methodology, two basic swimming motion patterns, cruise straight and C-shape sharp turning, are modelled and implemented in our robotic fish. The experimental results show that the relative tail motion and the approximation error function are good choices and the proposed method is feasible. ?? 2010 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Polymeric microactuators are potentially useful in micromechanical systems and lab-on-a-chip systems. However, manufacturing of miniature polymeric actuators has been complicated owing to the necessity of including electrodes for actuation or using lithographic techniques for patterning. Here, we demonstrate that all-polymer microdevices can be fabricated using inkjet printing technology in combination with self-organizing liquid-crystal network actuators. We exploit the self-assembling properties of the liquid crystal to create large strain gradients, and light-driven actuation is chosen to allow simple and remote addressing. By using multiple inks, microactuators with different subunits are created that can be selectively addressed by changing the wavelength of the light. The actuators mimic the motion of natural cilia. These artificial cilia have the potential to create flow and mixing in wet environments such as lab-on-a-chip applications. The process is easily adapted for roll-to-roll fabrication, allowing for large-scale and low-cost production of miniaturized active polymer systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A General Internal Model (GIM), which is an imitation of Central Pattern Generator (CPG) in nerve systems, is adopted to learn and to regenerate coordinated fish behaviors. By virtue of the universal function approximation ability and the temporal/spatial scalabilities of GIM, the proposed learning approach is able to generate the same or similar fish swimming patterns by tuning two parameters. The learned swimming patterns are implemented on a multi-joint robotic fish in experiments.

To better explore these structures, we derive continuum equations, valid in the limit of vanishing spacing between folds, to describe the smooth surface intersecting all the mountain folds. We find that this surface has negative Gaussian curvature with magnitude equal to the square of the fold's torsion. A series of open folds with constant fold angle generate a helicoid.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a soft, inflatable manipulator that is antagonistically actuated by tendons and pneumatics. The combination of the two actuation mechanisms in this antagonistic robot structure is inspired by the octopus which uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles to steer, elongate, shrink and also stiffen its continuum arms. By {\&}{\#}x201C;activating{\&}{\#}x201D; its antagonistic muscle groups at the same time, the octopus can achieve multiple motion patterns as well as stiffen their arms. Being organized in a similar fashion, our robot manipulator uses, on the one hand, pneumatic actuation and, on the other hand, tendon-based actuation - one opposing the other, achieving an overall antagonistic actuation framework. Controlling the pressure inside the robot while at the same time controlling the tendons' displacements, the robot can be moved into a wide range of configurations while simultaneously controlling the arm's stiffness. This paper builds on earlier work by the authors: Here, we present a new conic-shaped manipulator structure and the control architecture. Using a constant curvature model, we have derived an approach suitable for controlling the robot manipulator. The manipulator's reachable workspace is analyzed and proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show the robot's stiffness control and motion abilities.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in soft robotics, little attention has been paid to the development of soft matter computational mechanisms. Embedding computation directly into soft materials is not only necessary for the next generation of fully soft robots but also for smart materials to move beyond stimulus-response relationships and toward the intelligent behaviors seen in biological systems. This article describes soft matter computers (SMCs), low-cost, and easily fabricated computational mechanisms for soft robots. The building block of an SMC is a conductive fluid receptor (CFR), which maps a fluidic input signal to an electrical output signal via electrodes embedded into a soft tube. SMCs could perform both analog and digital computation. The potential of SMCs is demonstrated by integrating them into three soft robots: (i) a Softworm robot was controlled by an SMC that generated the control signals necessary for three distinct gaits; (ii) a soft gripper was given a set of reflexes that could be programmed by adjusting the parameters of the CFR; and (iii) a two–degree of freedom bending actuator was switched between three distinct behaviors by varying only one input parameter. SMCs are a low-cost way to integrate computation directly into soft materials and an important step toward entirely soft autonomous robots.},

Electroactive polymers are materials that change their geometry in response to electric field and can be used to replace electromechanical devices. The aim of this study is to show that these materials can be used to build more complicated devices and the behaviour of these devices can be coordinated to some extent. Both of the pectoral fins are built of eight electroactive polymer muscles. The experiments show that the fins are able to generate undulating motion and propel the body forward. The speed of the device is considerably slower than that of ray-like fishes but the device also has a smaller muscle mass and total mass ratio compared to aquatic animals.},

Here, we report a strategy to design tough transparent and conductive bonding of synthetic hydrogels containing 90{\%} water to non-porous surfaces of diverse solids, including glass, silicon, ceramics, titanium and aluminium. The design strategy is to anchor the long-chain polymer networks of tough hydrogels covalently to non-porous solid surfaces, which can be achieved by the silanation of such surfaces. Compared with physical interactions, the chemical anchorage results in a higher intrinsic work of adhesion and in significant energy dissipation of bulk hydrogel during detachment, which lead to interfacial toughness values over 1,000 J m-2. We also demonstrate applications of robust hydrogel-solid hybrids, including hydrogel superglues, mechanically protective hydrogel coatings, hydrogel joints for robotic structures and robust hydrogel-metal conductors.},

abstract = {During the past decades, hydrogels have been introduced suitable as novel materials for a variety of applications such as biomedical engineering, sanitary products, agriculture, bioseparation, enhanced oil recovery, etc. They have been successfully used as superabsorbent materials and in drug delivery, cell encapsulation and tissue repair due to their high water content and consequent biocompatibility. Considering the fact that water retention in the hydrogels provides a suitable drug diffusion pathway; many hydrogel-based networks have been designed and fabricated as intelligent carriers of drugs. The rate and degree of hydrogel swelling are the most important parameters which control the release patterns of solvents and drugs from these polymeric networks. Therefore, the precise account of hydrogel behaviour as well as mathematical description of equilibrium swelling, dimensional changes due to solvent uptake, desorption and drug release profiles were the main objectives in many investigations. The objective of this manuscript is to give a brief review on existing mathematical models and theories in the field of hydrogel swelling as well as the description of the drug release mechanism from swelling-controlled networks. The most important properties of hydrogels relevant to their swelling behaviour as well as kinetics and thermodynamic of swelling are also presented.},

abstract = {Direct ink writing (DIW) has demonstrated great potential as a multimaterial multifunctional fabrication method in areas as diverse as electronics, structural materials, tissue engineering, and soft robotics. During DIW, viscoelastic inks are extruded out of a 3D printer's nozzle as printed fibers, which are deposited into patterns when the nozzle moves. Hence, the resolution of printed fibers is commonly limited by the nozzle's diameter, and the printed pattern is limited by the motion paths. These limits have severely hampered innovations and applications of DIW 3D printing. Here, a new strategy to exceed the limits of DIW 3D printing by harnessing deformation, instability, and fracture of viscoelastic inks is reported. It is shown that a single nozzle can print fibers with resolution much finer than the nozzle diameter by stretching the extruded ink, and print various thickened or curved patterns with straight nozzle motions by accumulating the ink. A quantitative phase diagram is constructed to rationally select parameters for the new strategy. Further, applications including structures with tunable stiffening, 3D structures with gradient and programmable swelling properties, all printed with a single nozzle are demonstrated. The current work demonstrates that the mechanics of inks plays a critical role in developing 3D printing technology.},

The Ozawa method failed to describe the crystallization kinetics of the studied systems. The Avrami method was found to be useful for describing the nonisothermal crystallization behavior, but the parameters in this method do not have explicit meaning for nonisothermal crystallization. The combined Avrami-Ozawa method explained the nonisothermal crystallization behavior of PCL and its LDH nanocomposites effectively. The kinetic results and polarized optical microscopy observations indicated that the addition of LDH could affect the mechanism of nucleation and growth of the PCL matrix.

abstract = {Conventional three-dimensional printing processes are material-dependent, and are irreversible. We present an alternative approach based on three-dimensional assembly of mass-produced two-dimensional components of digital material. This significantly enlarges the available material set, allows reversible disassembly, and imposes constraints that reduce the accumulation of local positioning errors in constructing a global shape. Experimental work on material properties and dimensional scaling of the digital material will be presented, with application in assembling functional structures. We propose that assembling digital material will be the future of 3 -dimensional free-form fabrication of functional materials. Most existing commercial free-form fabrication printers build by putting together small quantities of no more than a few expensive materials. In order to make high-resolution objects they need to be very precise and therefore cost between tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars and are operated by skilled technicians. On the other hand young children build 3-dimensional structures out of LEGO with their hands. LEGO structures are cheap, quick and easy to make, reversible and most importantly they are more precise than the kids who build them. However, they are big and are only made out of ABS plastic. We believe that digital materials bring reversibility, simplicity, low cost and speed to free form fabrication in addition to a larger material set. Previous research on structures built out of many discrete parts involved self assembly [1], error correction self assembly [2], programmable self-assembly [3] and folding[4]. We rely on a digital printer, as presented in [5] which will assemble the structure by picking and placing the bricks forming the digital material. We define a digital material as a discrete set of components that can be of any sizes and shape, made out of various materials and that can fit together in various ways (press fit, friction fit, snap fit, reflow binding, etc.). However the components of a digital material must satisfy the following properties which are familiar to many toy assembly kits:},

Composed of soft and biocompatible materials, gel robots can easily bend and fold, interface and manipulate biological components and transport cargo in aqueous solutions. Electrical fields in aqueous solutions offer repeatable and controllable stimuli, which induce actuation by the re-distribution of ions in the system. Electrical fields applied to polyelectrolyte-doped gels submerged in ionic solution distribute the mobile ions asymmetrically to create osmotic pressure differences that swell and deform the gels. The sign of the fixed charges on the polyelectrolyte network determines the direction of bending, which we harness to control the motion of the gel legs in opposing directions as a response to electrical fields. We present and analyze a walking gel actuator comprised of cationic and anionic gel legs made of copolymer networks of acrylamide (AAm)/sodium acrylate (NaAc) and acrylamide/quaternized dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA Q), respectively. The anionic and cationic legs were attached by electric field-promoted polyion complexation. We characterize the electro-actuated response of the sodium acrylate hydrogel as a function of charge density and external salt concentration. We demonstrate that "osmotically passive" fixed charges play an important role in controlling the bending magnitude of the gel networks. The gel walkers achieve unidirectional motion on flat elastomer substrates and exemplify a simple way to move and manipulate soft matter devices and robots in aqueous solutions. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Adaptation of conventional systems of control to soft devices requires hard valves and electronic controls. This paper describes completely soft pneumatic digital logic gates having a physical scale appropriate for use with current (macroscopic) soft actuators. Each digital logic gate utilizes a single bistable valve—the pneumatic equivalent of a Schmitt trigger—which relies on the snap-through instability of a hemispherical membrane to kink internal tubes and operates with binary high/low input and output pressures. Soft, pneumatic NOT, AND, and OR digital logic gates—which generate known pneumatic outputs as a function of one, or multiple, pneumatic inputs—allow fabrication of digital logic circuits for a set–reset latch, two-bit shift register, leading-edge detector, digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and toggle switch. The DAC and toggle switch, in turn, can control and power a soft actuator (demonstrated using a pneu-net gripper). These macroscale soft digital logic gates are scalable to high volumes of airflow, do not consume power at steady state, and can be reconfigured to achieve multiple functionalities from a single design (including configurations that receive inputs from the environment and from human users). This work represents a step toward a strategy to develop autonomous control—one not involving an electronic interface or hard components—for soft devices.},

The natural analogues of such systems are exemplified by nastic plant motions, where a variety of organs such as tendrils, bracts, leaves and flowers respond to environmental stimuli (such as humidity, light or touch) by varying internal turgor, which leads to dynamic conformations governed by the tissue composition and microstructural anisotropy of cell walls. Inspired by these botanical systems, we printed composite hydrogel architectures that are encoded with localized, anisotropic swelling behaviour controlled by the alignment of cellulose fibrils along prescribed four-dimensional printing pathways. When combined with a minimal theoretical framework that allows us to solve the inverse problem of designing the alignment patterns for prescribed target shapes, we can programmably fabricate plant-inspired architectures that change shape on immersion in water, yielding complex three-dimensional morphologies.},

abstract = {We have been interested in the synthesis of hydrogels with fast swelling kinetics and superabsorbent properties. To increase the water absorption rate, interconnected pores were introduced to the hydrogels. Since the pore size in the dried hydrogels is in the order of hundreds of micrometers, these hydrogels are called "superporous" hydrogels. Superporous hydrogels were synthesized by crosslinking polymerization of various vinyl monomers in the presence of gas bubbles formed by the chemical reaction of acid and NaHCO3. The polymerization process was optimized to capture the gas bubbles inside the synthesized hydrogels. The use of the NaHCO3/acid system allowed easy control of timing for gelation and foam formation. We found that PF127 was the best foam stabilizer for most of the monomer systems used in our study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures showed interconnected pores forming capillary channels. The capillary channels, which were critical for fast swelling, were preserved during drying by dehydrating water-swollen hydrogels with ethanol before drying. The ethanol-dehydrated superporous hydrogels reached equilibrium swelling within minutes. The equilibrium swelling time could be reduced to less than a minute with the use of a wetting agent. In our study, water moisture was used as a wetting agent since the amount of moisture content in the dried hydrogels easily could be controlled. Preparation of superporous hydrogels using the right blowing system, foam stabilizer, drying method, and wetting agent makes it possible to reduce the swelling time to less than a minute regardless of the size of the dried gels. The superporous hydrogels can be used where fast swelling and superabsorbent properties are critical. {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Robots that are not only robust, dynamic, and gentle in the human ro-bot interaction, but are also able to perform precise and repeatable movements, need accurate dynamics modeling and a high-performance closed-loop control. As a technological basis we propose robots with intrinsically compliant joints, a stiff link structure, and a soft shell. The flexible joints are driven by Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) with a mechanical spring coupling between the motor and the ac-tuator output and the ability to change the mechanical stiffness of the spring cou-pling. Several model based and model free control approaches have been devel-oped for this technology, e.g. Cartesian stiffness control, optimal control, reactions, reflexes, and cyclic motion control. 20.1 Introduction Robots interacting with humans in direct physical contact or even acting in place of a human in given situations are of high interest for current research. Manipulat-ing objects in direct contact with the human or in unstructured environment likely results in contacts and collisions that are unpredictable. Furthermore, the desired robot skills include fine manipulation as well as highly dynamic and powerful movements. This results in special demands on the robots capabilities:  Robustness to fast impacts to reduce the risk of robot damage  Precision for fine manipulation  Sensitivity for gentle interaction with the environment  High dynamics for fast and controlled movements},

Considering kinematic constraints and hydrodynamic forces, Lagrangian formulation is used to obtain the dynamic model of the fish. Using this model, three major locomotion patterns of Anguilliform fish, including forward locomotion, backward locomotion and turning locomotion are investigated. It is found that the fish exhibits different locomotion patterns by giving different reference joint angles, such as adding reversed phase difference, or adding deflections to the original reference angles. The results are validated by both simulations and experiments. Furthermore, the relations among the speed of the fish, angular frequency, undulation amplitude, phase difference, as well as the relationship between the turning radius and deflection angle are investigated. These relations provide an elaborated motion library that can be used for motion planning of the robotic fish. {\textcopyright}2013 Jilin University.},

We demonstrate a dynamic thermal control of the surface topography of LCE coatings achieved through pre-designed patterns of in-plane molecular orientation. These patterns determine whether the LCE coating develops elevations, depressions, or in-plane deformations. The deterministic dependence of the out-of-plane dynamic surface profile on the in-plane orientational pattern is explained by activation forces. These forces are caused by two factors: (i) stretching-contraction of the polymer networks driven by temperature; (ii) spatially varying orientation of the LCE. The activation force concept brings the responsive LCEs into the domain of active matter. The demonstrated relationship can be used to design programmable coatings with functionalities that mimic biological tissues such as skin.},

As CRMs potentially consist of thousands of nodes with limited processing power and memory, communication in such systems poses serious challenges. For example, when processing a gesture recorded by the CRM, only a subset of nodes involved in its detection should communicate amongst themselves for distributed proessing.

We present the governing equations and equilibrium conditions of an isothermal process based on the monophase gel field theory of hydrogel via a variational approach. We have adopted and implemented an explicit form of energy for temperature-sensitive hydrogel in a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) using a user-supply subroutine in ABAQUS. For verification purpose, a few numerical results obtained by the proposed approach are compared with existing experimental data and analytical solutions. They are all in good agreement.

In this manuscript, we propose a novel two-component soft actuator design and design tool that produces actuators targeted towards these applications with enhanced mechanical performance and manufacturability. Our numerical models developed using the finite element method can predict the actuator behavior at large mechanical strains to allow efficient design iterations for system optimization. Based on two distinctive actuator prototypes' (linear and bending actuators) experimental results that include free displacement and blocked-forces, we have validated the efficacy of the numerical models. The presented extensive investigation of mechanical performance for soft actuators with varying geometric parameters demonstrates the practical application of the design tool, and the robustness of the actuator hardware design, towards diverse soft robotic systems for a wide set of assistive wearable technologies, including replicating the motion of several parts of the human body.},

This study takes inspirations from biological world to practical control algorithms. In detail, an iterative learning scheme based control is studied with the cooperation of a filter to reduce the measurement noise, and a curve fitting component to keep the necessary phase difference between neighboring fin rays. Moreover, the iterative learning control algorithm is designed and implemented for practical applications. The experimental results validate that the proposed learning control can effectively improve the propulsion of RoboGnilos.

abstract = {As polymer networks infiltrated with water, hydrogels constitute the major components of the human body; and hydrogels have been widely used in applications that closely interact with biological organisms, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and biological research. More recently, owing to their superior softness, wetness, responsiveness, biocompatibility, and bioactivity, hydrogels are being intensively investigated for versatile functions in devices and machines including sensors, actuators, coatings, optics, electronics, and water harvesters. A nascent field named hydrogel machines rapidly evolves, exploiting hydrogels as key components for devices and machines. While there are reviews on individual categories of hydrogel machines in literature, a comprehensive discussion on various categories of hydrogel machines that systematically correlate hydrogels' properties and machines' functions is still missing in the field. This review is aimed to provide such a panoramic overview. We first classify various hydrogel machines into a number of categories according to their applications. For each category, we discuss (i) the working principles of the hydrogel machines, (ii) the specific properties of hydrogels that enable the key functions of the machines, and (iii) challenges faced by hydrogel machines and recent developments to address them. The field of hydrogel machines will not only translate fundamental understanding of hydrogels into new applications, but also shift the paradigm in machine design by integrating hydrogels that can potentially minimize physical and physiological mismatches with biological organisms.},

Balancing the workspace and stiffness of the slender continuum manipulator is a primary design concern. Thus, studies have been consistently dedicated to designing continuum manipulators with high or variable stiffness. This paper proposes a 2-segment continuum manipulator with adjustable stiffness based on continuously constrained bending curvature. The manipulator's stiffness is further enhanced via redundant backbone arrangement using the concept of dual continuum mechanism during the design phase. The Cosserat rod theory is used for the kinestatic model to calculate the tip stiffness of the manipulator. A stiffness control formulation utilizes the configuration redundancy of the manipulator to achieve stiffness variation control in a desired direction at a target position. The design concepts, system construction, kinestatic models, stiffness control formulation and experimental validations are presented. The experimental results showed that the tip stiffness of the manipulator can be adjusted in various directions with an enhancement up to 10.83 times of the minimal stiffness, indicating the efficacy of the proposed design and the stiffness control formulation.},

abstract = {Two important aspects of actuation behavior of stimuli‐responsive hydrogels are the complexity of the shape change and its speed. Here, it is shown that varying the shape of simple polymer bilayers can result in very complex and very fast spontaneous folding. The complexity and high folding rate arise from the choice of the shape and from the presence of inhomogeneous swelling within the thermoresponsive layer entrapped between the top hydrophobic layer and the substrate. In contrast to homogeneous swelling of a freestanding bilayer, which leads to a gradual increase of curvature throughout the whole bilayer, inhomogeneous swelling first results in complete rolling of the periphery of the film, which changes its mechanical properties and affects the subsequent morphing process. Further swelling of the thermoresponsive layer generates more stress that builds up until a buckling threshold is overcome, allowing very fast switching from the flat edge‐rolled configuration into a folded one. The research demonstrates how the introduction of holes into actuating bilayers gives rise not only to a novel geometric control over the folding fate of the films but also adds the ability to tune the rate of folding, through the careful selection of hole size, location, and shape.},

Integrating these functional living components into materials and devices will provide powerful tools for scientific research and enable new technological applications. However, it has been a grand challenge to maintain the viability, functionality, and safety of living components in freestanding materials and devices, which frequently undergo deformations during applications. Here, we report the design of a set of living materials and devices based on stretchable, robust, and biocompatible hydrogel-elastomer hybrids that host various types of genetically engineered bacterial cells. The hydrogel provides sustainable supplies of water and nutrients, and the elastomer is air-permeable, maintaining long-term viability and functionality of the encapsulated cells. Communication between different bacterial strains and with the environment is achieved via diffusion of molecules in the hydrogel. The high stretchability and robustness of the hydrogel-elastomer hybrids prevent leakage of cells from the living materials and devices, even under large deformations. We show functions and applications of stretchable living sensors that are responsive to multiple chemicals in a variety of form factors, including skin patches and gloves-based sensors.

In fact, musculature has been deemed the “prototypical soft actuator” because it can achieve fast, strong actuation and remarkably complex patterns of movement. [1] Replication of these motions with traditional robotic systems is challenging, and involves complex mechanisms and many actuators. Furthermore, while the impedance of a robotic system can be modulated using force feedback and advanced control methods, it is diffi cult to achieve values similar to biological tissue. The emerging fi eld of “soft robotics” lends itself to replicating biomimetic motions, having simple and low cost actuation and the capability to achieve bending, twisting, extension and fl exion with non-rigid materials. However, complex motion often requires specifi cally designed actuators with multiple internal channels or complex cavities for actuation.

The gel preparation temperature (Tprep) was varied between -22 and 25 °C. It was found that the swelling properties and the elastic behavior of the hydrogels drastically change at Tprep=-8 °C. The hydrogels prepared below -8 °C exhibit a discontinuous morphology consisting of polyhedral pores of sizes 30-50 $\mu$m, while those formed at higher temperatures have a non-porous structure. The pore size of the networks increased by decreasing the charge density of the hydrogels, while addition of low molecular weight salts into the gelation system reduced the size of the pores. Calculations based on the equilibrium between the ice and unfrozen gel phases in the reaction system at low temperatures explain the results of observations. It was also shown that the hydrogels formed below -8 °C exhibit superfast swelling properties as well as reversible swelling-deswelling cycles in water and acetone. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A fish robot employing a carangiform swimming mode had been used as an experimental platform for the performance study. The experiments conducted aim to investigate the effect of various design parameters on the thrust capability of the fish robot with a flexible caudal fin. The controllable parameters associated with the fin include frequency, amplitude of oscillation, aspect ratio and the rigidity of the caudal fin. The significance of these parameters was determined in the first set of experiments by using a statistical approach. A more detailed parametric experimental study was then conducted with only those significant parameters. As a result, the parametric study could be completed with a reduced number of experiments and time spent. With the obtained experimental result, we were able to understand the relationship between various parameters and a possible adjustment of parameters to obtain a higher thrust. The proposed statistical method for experimentation provides an objective and thorough analysis of the effects of individual or combinations of parameters on the swimming performance. Such an efficient experimental design helps to optimize the process and determine factors that influence variability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim As one of the most promising smart materials, stimuli-responsive polymer hydrogels (SPHs) can reversibly change volume or shape in response to external stimuli. They thus have shown promising applications in many fields. While considerable progress of 2D deformation of SPHs has been achieved, the realization of 3D or even more complex deformation still remains a significant challenge. Here, a general strategy towards designing multiresponsive, macroscopically anisotropic SPHs (MA-SPHs) with the ability of 3D complex deformations is reported. Through a local UV-reduction of graphene oxide sheets (GOs) with a patterned fashion in the GO-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (GO-PNIPAM) composite hydrogel sheet, MA-SPHs can be achieved after the introduction of a second poly(methylacrylic acid) network in the unreduced part of GO-PNIPAM hydrogel sheet. The resulting 3D MA-SPHs can provide remote-controllable light-driven, as well as thermo-, pH-, and ionic strength-triggered multiresponsive 3D complex deformations. Approaches in this study may provide new insights in designing and fabricating intelligent soft materials for bioinspired applications.},

abstract = {Direct ink writing (DIW) has demonstrated great potential as a multimaterial multifunctional fabrication method in areas as diverse as electronics, structural materials, tissue engineering, and soft robotics. During DIW, viscoelastic inks are extruded out of a 3D printer's nozzle as printed fibers, which are deposited into patterns when the nozzle moves. Hence, the resolution of printed fibers is commonly limited by the nozzle's diameter, and the printed pattern is limited by the motion paths. These limits have severely hampered innovations and applications of DIW 3D printing. Here, a new strategy to exceed the limits of DIW 3D printing by harnessing deformation, instability, and fracture of viscoelastic inks is reported. It is shown that a single nozzle can print fibers with resolution much finer than the nozzle diameter by stretching the extruded ink, and print various thickened or curved patterns with straight nozzle motions by accumulating the ink. A quantitative phase diagram is constructed to rationally select parameters for the new strategy. Further, applications including structures with tunable stiffening, 3D structures with gradient and programmable swelling properties, all printed with a single nozzle are demonstrated. The current work demonstrates that the mechanics of inks plays a critical role in developing 3D printing technology.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous assembly of coded microgels in enclosed aquatic environments is demonstrated using a remotely actuated and controlled magnetic microgripper by a customized electromagnetic coil system. The microgripper uses different 'stick-slip' and 'rolling' locomotion in 2D and also levitation in 3D by magnetic gradient-based pulling force. This enables the microrobot to precisely manipulate each microgel by controlling its position and orientation in all x-y-z directions. Our microrobotic assembly method broke the barrier of limitation on the number of assembled microgel layers, because it enabled precise 3D levitation of the microgripper. We used the gripper to assemble microgels that had been coded with different colours and shapes onto prefabricated polymeric microposts. This eliminates the need for extra secondary cross-linking to fix the final construct. We demonstrated assembly of microgels on a single micropost up to ten layers. By increasing the number and changing the distribution of the posts, complex heterogeneous microsystems were possible to construct in 3D.},

An important requirement to enable self-contained soft mobile robots is an on-board power source. In this paper, we present an approach to create a bio-inspired soft robotic snake that can undulate in a similar way to its biological counterpart using pressure for actuation power, without human intervention. With this approach, we develop an autonomous soft snake robot with on-board actuation, power, computation and control capabilities. The robot consists of four bidirectional fluidic elastomer actuators in series to create a traveling curvature wave from head to tail along its body. Passive wheels between segments generate the necessary frictional anisotropy for forward locomotion. It takes 14 h to build the soft robotic snake, which can attain an average locomotion speed of 19 mm s(-1).},

PNIPAM-MAPOSS hybrid hydrogel, based on the introduction of acrylolsobutyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (MAPOSS) into the PNIPAM matrix in the presence of polyethylene glycol, was prepared via radical polymerization. The modified hydrogels exhibited a thick, heterogeneous porous structure. PEG was used as a pore-forming agent to adjust the pore size. MAPOSS reduced the swelling ratios of gels, and decreased the LCST, causing the hydrogels to shrink at lower temperatures. However, its hydrophobicity helped to improve the temperature response rate. The incorporation of rigid MAPOSS into the polymer network greatly increased the compressive modulus of the hydrogel. It is worth noting that, by adjusting the amount of MAPOSS and PEG, the hydrogel could have both ideal mechanical properties and swelling behavior. In addition, hydrogel containing 8.33 wt {\%} MAPOSS could achieve stable and sustained drug release. Thus, the prepared PNIPAM-MAPOSS hybrid hydrogel can serve as drug carrier for 5-fluorouracil and may have potential application in other biomedical fields.},

Robotic skins integrate actuation and sensing into a single conformable material and may be leveraged to create a multitude of controllable soft robots with different functions or gaits to accommodate the demands of different environments. We show that attaching the same robotic skin to a soft body in different ways, or to different soft bodies, leads to distinct motions. Further, we show that combining multiple robotic skins enables complex motions and functions. We demonstrate the versatility of this soft robot design approach in a wide range of applications—including manipulation tasks, locomotion, and wearables—using the same two-dimensional (2D) robotic skins reconfigured on the surface of various 3D soft, inanimate objects.},

An improved Central Pattern Generator (CPG) model allowing free adjustment of phase relationship and directional bias is employed to achieve flexible swimming and smooth transition. Considering the characteristics of forward swimming in carangiform fish and backward swimming in anguilliform fish, various backward swimming patterns for the sub-carangiform robotic fish are suitably created by reversing the direction of propagating propulsive waves. Through a combined use of the CPG control and closed-loop swimming direction control strategy, flexible and precise turning maneuvers in both forward and backward swimming are implemented and compared. By contrast with forward swimming, backward swimming requires a higher frequency or an increased lateral displacement to reach the same relative swimming speed. Noticeably, the phase difference shows a greater impact on forward swimming than on backward swimming. Our observations also indicate that the robotic fish achieves a larger turning rate in forward maneuvering than in backward maneuvering, yet these two maneuvers display comparable turning precision. {\textcopyright} 2014 Jilin University.},

The wood hydrogel exhibits a high–tensile strength of 36 MPa along the longitudinal direction due to the strong bonding and cross-linking between the aligned cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) in wood and the polyacrylamide (PAM) polymer. The wood hydrogel is 5 times and 500 times stronger than the bacterial cellulose hydrogels (7.2 MPa) and the unmodified PAM hydrogel (0.072 MPa), respectively, representing one of the strongest hydrogels ever reported.

abstract = {Research in the medical and psychological fields has primarily followed a “disease-focused” approach to health. Although there is growing research on the components and outcomes of well-being, very few studies have focused on traditional practices that can be used as interventions to encourage human flourishing. The current study was developed to address this research gap. We suggest one effective method of increasing psychological well-being, the practice of yoga, an age-old practice that has been said to produce physical and psychological health. In this observational study, we examined associations with participation in a 4-week yoga teacher training resident program. Measurement instruments were chosen to capture changes in psychosocial health and human flourishing. Measurements were taken before the start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram. As expected, in this healthy population, the human flourishing scales showed more change than the psychosocial health scales. For example, in this healthy sample, there were no significant changes in perceived social support, quality of life, or self-efficacy from baseline to the 3-month follow-up. However, optimism, a positive psychology research measure, improved from baseline to follow-up. The mindfulness subscales of observation, awareness, and nonreactivity all improved following the training, suggesting that one benefit of yoga practice is a more refined ability to attend to one's inner experience. This study adds to the growing literature focusing on interventions that move beyond relieving pathology to those that produce optimal functioning and human thriving.},

abstract = {Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring Materials Scientists in the design of novel materials.$\backslash$nTheir defining characteristics, hierarchy, multifunctionality, and self-healing capability, are illustrated. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. The basic building blocks are described, starting with the 20 amino acids and proceeding to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides–saccharides. These, on their turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of ‘soft tissues' and are also present in most biominerals. There are over 1000 proteins, and we describe only the principal ones, with emphasis on collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The ‘hard' phases are primarily strengthened by minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases are discussed: hydroxyapatite, silica, and aragonite.$\backslash$nUsing the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are presented. Selected systems in each class are described with emphasis on the relationship between their structure and mechanical response. A fifth class is added to this: functional biological materials, which have a structure developed for a specific function: adhesion, optical properties, etc.$\backslash$nAn outgrowth of this effort is the search for bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methodologies of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. The new frontiers reside in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems; these involve nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures. Although this approach is still in its infancy, it will eventually lead to a plethora of new materials systems as we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of growth and the structure of biological systems.},

abstract = {The mechanism of variation of mass and volume, through the absorption of water, by the most commonly used and abundantly available spherical hydrogel beads of various colours has been studied. Immersing the beads in distilled water, both mass and volume were measured at regular intervals. By an analysis of mass-versus-time data, using standard theoretical methods, the mechanism of diffusion of water has been studied. Relaxation controlled transport was found to be the predominant process of diffusion of water into the materials under study. The diffusion coefficient has been determined for hydrogels of different colours. Various swelling related parameters such as equilibrium water content, equilibrium swelling ratio, characteristic time, initial rate of water absorption etc. were determined for these hydrogels. The maximum attainable mass and the maximum number water molecules that can be attached to active polymer sites in a single bead have been calculated. In this regard, the number of such active sites per unit volume and mass of dry hydrogel was determined. A theoretical model has been developed, based on the consideration of water absorption through the occupation of vacant polymer sites in a highly porous hydrogel. Considerations of cylindrical and spherical pores in this model predicted almost the same swelling behaviour. Expressions relating mass and volume with time have been formulated and they agreed well with experimental observations. The dependence of characteristic time ({\$}\tau{\$}) upon structural parameters have been established. Values of swelling related parameters have been determined by a numerical fitting of theoretical model to experimental data. The agreement of experimental findings with theoretical predictions has been depicted graphically.},

abstract = {Freshwater stingrays undulate their flexible disc-like pectoral fins to perform cruising, manoeuvring, and other motions. This undulatory propulsion has a higher propulsive efficiency and more precise manoeuvrability than most other species at low swimming velocity. In the current study, a new robotic fish inspired by the freshwater stingray was developed and tested. First, the morphology and kinematic patterns of the freshwater stingray were presented. A kinematic model of the pectoral fin was established based on several assumptions. Then a robotic stingray with an undulatory pectoral fin was designed and developed. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of various fin actuation parameters on its linear swimming velocity and the forces generated by the robotic stingray. The controllable fin parameters include oscillation frequency, wave number, maximal angular deflection of the fin rays, and the amplitude pattern of the pectoral fin. The experimental results indicate that the developed prototype is able to generate adequate thrust for self-propulsion. Linear swimming velocity and surge force increase rapidly with oscillation frequency, angular deflection, and wave number. A maximum velocity of 4.3 cm??s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}(nearly 0.18 Body Lengths per second (BL??s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})) and a maximum surge force of 102 mN are achieved at an oscillation frequency of 0.5 Hz, a wave number of 1, a maximum angular deflection of 30??, and an equal amplitude pattern. The sway force of the robotic fish fluctuates around 0 mN. The heave force varies with wave number and reaches its minimum at a wave number of 1.},

Results revealed high frequencies and multiple types and contexts of SEM use, with men's usage rates systematically higher than women's. Regression analyses revealed that both the frequency of SEM use and number of SEM types viewed were uniquely associated with more sexual experience (a higher number of overall and casual sexual intercourse partners, as well as a lower age at first intercourse). Higher frequencies of SEM use were associated with less sexual and relationship satisfaction. The frequency of SEM use and number of SEM types viewed were both associated with higher sexual preferences for the types of sexual practices typically presented in SEM. These findings suggest that SEM use can play a significant role in a variety of aspects of young adults' sexual development processes.},

Replicating these capabilities with engineered materials is challenging because of the difficulty in manufacturing and controlling soft material actuators with embedded fibers. In addition, while linear and bending motions are common in soft actuators, rotary motions require three-dimensional fiber wrapping or multiple bending or linear elements working in coordination that are challenging to design and fabricate. In this work, an automatic embroidery machine patterned Kevlar™ fibers and stretchable optical fibers into inflatable silicone membranes to control their inflated shape and enable sensing. This embroidery-based fabrication technique is simple, low cost, and allows for precise and custom patterning of fibers in elastomers. Using this technique, we developed inflatable elastomeric actuators embedded with a planar spiral pattern of high-strength Kevlar™ fibers that inflate into radially symmetric shapes and achieve nearly 180° angular rotation and 10 cm linear displacement.},

In order to increase the speed of development, reduce the occurrence of manufacturing problems inherent with current design methods, and reduce the level of expertise required to develop new devices, the framework has been implemented in a new design tool called popupCAD, which is suited for the design and development of complex folded laminate devices.

There is a large body of work simulating compliant mechanisms. These normally assume small deformations with homogeneous material properties actuated with external forces. There is also a large body of research on physically based deformable objects for applications in computer graphics with the purpose of generating realistic appearances at the expense of accuracy. Here we present a simulation framework in which an object may be composed of any number of interspersed materials with varying properties (stiffness, density, Poisson's ratio, thermal expansion coefficient, and friction coefficients) to enable true heterogeneous multimaterial simulation. Collisions are handled to prevent self-penetration due to large deformation, which also allows multiple bodies to interact. A volumetric actuation method is implemented to impart motion to the structures, which opens the door to the design of novel structures, and mechanisms. The simulator was implemented efficiently such that objects with thousands of degrees of freedom can be simulated at suitable frame rates for user interaction with a single thread of a typical desktop computer. The code is written in platform agnostic C++ and is fully open source. This research opens the door to the dynamic simulation of freeform 3D multimaterial mechanisms and objects in a manner suitable for design automation.},

abstract = {Rolling locomotion using an external force such as gravity has evolved many times. However, some caterpillars can curl into a wheel and generate their own rolling momentum as part of an escape repertoire. This change in body conformation occurs well within 100 ms and generates a linear velocity over 0.2 m s(-1), making it one of the fastest self-propelled wheeling behaviors in nature. Inspired by this behavior, we construct a soft-bodied robot to explore the dynamics and control issues of ballistic rolling. This robot, called GoQBot, closely mimics caterpillar rolling. Analyzing the whole body kinematics and 2D ground reaction forces at the robot ground anchor reveals about 1G of acceleration and more than 200 rpm of angular velocity. As a novel rolling robot, GoQBot demonstrates how morphing can produce new modes of locomotion. Furthermore, mechanical coupling of the actuators improves body coordination without sensory feedback. Such coupling is intrinsic to soft-bodied animals because there are no joints to isolate muscle-generated movements. Finally, GoQBot provides an estimate of the mechanical power for caterpillar rolling that is comparable to that of a locust jump. How caterpillar musculature produces such power in such a short time is yet to be discovered.},

Compared to rigid grippers, end?effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control. Improved materials, processing methods, and sensing play an important role in future research.},

abstract = {We present an untethered, electrostatic, MEMS micro-robot, with dimensions of 60 {\&}mu;m by 250 {\&}mu;m by 10 {\&}mu;m. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7{\&}deg;/mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 {\&}mu;m, and achieve speeds of over 200 {\&}mu;m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium, which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-{\&}mu;m microfabricated electrodes, arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-{\&}mu;m spaces. The electrodes are insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Hysteresis in the system allows on-board storage of n=2 bits of state information in response to these electrical signals. The presence of on-board state information within the device itself allows each of the two device subsystems (USDA and steering arm) to be individually addressed and controlled- . We describe this communication and control strategy and show necessary and sufficient conditions for voltage-selective actuation of all 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}n{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}system states, both for our devices (n=2), and for the more general case (where n is larger.).},

Here a universal soaking strategy has been presented to synthesize tough magnetic nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels. We can simultaneously solve two common issues for magnetic hydrogels: the poor mechanical properties and poor distribution of magnetic particles. The toughness of the magnetic NC hydrogel achieves approximately 11:000 J m-2. The outstanding properties of tough magnetic hydrogels will enable myriad applications. Here we demonstrate a new application for remotely triggered shape morphing. Heterogeneous structures based on magnetic hydrogels are shown to evolve into bio-inspired three-dimensional (3D) shapes (lotus flowers) from 2D-structured sheets. The self-folding of the structure is controlled by the magnetothermal effect in an alternating magnetic field. The capability to control the shape morphing of a multi-material system by a magnetic field may emerge as a new general strategy for programming complex soft structures.},

In an earthworm, each individual metamere is actuated by circular and longitudinal muscles that are activated synchronously by the animal's nervous system. Here, adopting the basic functional principles of metameric worms, we propose a new pneumatically-driven soft robotic system that mimics the motions and replicates the functionality of a single burrowing earthworm's segment. The suitability of the proposed approach is demonstrated experimentally through three basic locomotion tests: horizontal motion, vertical motion and oblique motion inside a varying-slope transparent pipe.

In fact, musculature has been deemed the “prototypical soft actuator” because it can achieve fast, strong actuation and remarkably complex patterns of movement. [1] Replication of these motions with traditional robotic systems is challenging, and involves complex mechanisms and many actuators. Furthermore, while the impedance of a robotic system can be modulated using force feedback and advanced control methods, it is diffi cult to achieve values similar to biological tissue. The emerging fi eld of “soft robotics” lends itself to replicating biomimetic motions, having simple and low cost actuation and the capability to achieve bending, twisting, extension and fl exion with non-rigid materials. However, complex motion often requires specifi cally designed actuators with multiple internal channels or complex cavities for actuation. [1–6] As depicted in Figure 1 a, if we look to biology for inspiration, complex motion in soft muscular structures is often achieved through the functional arrangement of many simple contractile elements arranged spatially in a soft matrix (Figure 1 b), and actuated synergistically.},

Actuators utilizing stimuli-responsive hydrogel materials have a number of advantages compared to conventional ones, including relatively simple fabrication and large force generation. The thermal actuator here utilizes a temperature-sensitive hydrogel to provide an adjustable force/pressure with a fast dynamic response. The actuator is used as part of a hydrogel-based pH sensor, where force compensation via this actuator keeps the sensor in its initial state and, hence, avoids relaxation and drift process. A finite element simulation with ANSYS is introduced to assess temperature distribution and maximum allowable actuating pressure in this actuator. Three actuators are assembled and tested. Two crucial factors, including the depth of the hydrogel reservoir and the filling factor of hydrogel, are investigated to improve the response time (1.9 min) and actuating pressure (65 kPa), respectively. The trade-off between actuating pressure and response time should be carefully considered in the further work.},

abstract = {Increasing the energy and power density of piezoelectric actuators is very important for any weight-sensitive application, and is especially crucial for enabling autonomy in micro/milli-scale robots and devices utilizing this technology. This is achieved by maximizing the mechanical flexural strength and electrical dielectric strength through the use of laser-induced melting or polishing, insulating edge coating, and crack-arresting features, combined with features for rigid ground attachments to maximize force output. Manufacturing techniques have also been developed to enable mass customization, in which sheets of material are pre-stacked to form a laminate from which nearly arbitrary planar actuator designs can be fabricated using only laser cutting. These techniques have led to a 70{\%} increase in energy density and an increase in mean lifetime of at least 15× compared to prior manufacturing methods. In addition, measurements have revealed a doubling of the piezoelectric coefficient when operating at the high fields necessary to achieve maximal energy densities, along with an increase in the Young's modulus at the high compressive strains encountered - these two effects help to explain the higher performance of our actuators as compared to that predicted by linear models. {\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This hybrid method reduces the sensitivity to noise that may be caused by variations in electrical resistance of the wire interface and undesired stress applied to signal routing areas.

abstract = {Conspectus The formation of well-defined and functional three-dimensional (3D) structures by buckling of thin sheets subjected to spatially nonuniform stresses is common in biological morphogenesis and has become a subject of great interest in synthetic systems, as such programmable shape-morphing materials hold promise in areas including drug delivery, biomedical devices, soft robotics, and biomimetic systems. Given their ability to undergo large changes in swelling in response to a wide variety of stimuli, hydrogels have naturally emerged as a key type of material in this field. Of particular interest are hybrid systems containing rigid inclusions that can define both the anisotropy and spatial nonuniformity of swelling as well as nanoparticulate additives that can enhance the responsiveness and functionality of the material. In this Account, we discuss recent progress in approaches to achieve well-defined shape morphing in hydrogel hybrids. First, we provide an overview of materials and methods that facilitate fabrication of such systems and outline the geometry and mechanics behind shape morphing of thin sheets. We then discuss how patterning of stiff inclusions within soft responsive hydrogels can be used to program both bending and swelling, thereby providing access to a wide array of complex 3D forms. The use of discretely patterned stiff regions to provide an effective composite response offers distinct advantages in terms of scalability and ease of fabrication compared with approaches based on smooth gradients within a single layer of responsive material. We discuss a number of recent advances wherein control of the mechanical properties and geometric characteristics of patterned stiff elements enables the formation of 3D shapes, including origami-inspired structures, concatenated helical frameworks, and surfaces with nonzero Gaussian curvature. Next, we outline how the inclusion of functional elements such as nanoparticles can enable unique pathways to programmable and even reprogrammable shape-morphing materials. We focus to a large extent on photothermally reprogrammable systems that include one of a variety of additives that serve to efficiently absorb light and convert it into heat, thereby driving the response of a temperature-sensitive hydrogel. Such systems are advantageous in that patterns of light can be defined with very high spatial and temporal resolution in addition to offering the potential for wavelength-selective addressability of multiple different inclusions. We highlight recent advances in the preparation of light-responsive hybrid systems capable of undergoing reprogrammable bending and buckling into well-defined 3D shapes. In addition, we describe several examples where shape tuning of hybrid systems enables control over the motion of responsive hydrogel-based materials. Finally, we offer our perspective on open challenges and future areas of interest for the field.},

abstract = {Shape-shifting of flat materials into the desired 3D configuration is an alternative design route for fabrication of complex 3D shapes, which provides many benefits such as access to the flat material surface and the ability to produce well-described motions. The advanced production techniques that primarily work in 2D could then be used to add complex surface features to the flat material. The combination of complex 3D shapes and surface-related functionalities has a wide range of applications in biotechnology, actuators/sensors, and engineering of complex metamaterials. Here, we categorize the different programming strategies that could be used for planning the shape-shifting of soft matter based on the type of stresses generated inside the flat material and present an overview of the ways those mechanisms could be used to achieve the desired 3D shapes. Stress gradients through the thickness of the material, which generate out-of-plane bending moments, and compressive in-plane stresses that result in out-of-plane buckling constitute the major mechanisms through which shape-shifting of the flat matter could be programmed. We review both programming strategies with a focus on the underlying physical principles, which are highly scalable and could be applied to other structures and materials. The techniques used for programming the time sequence of shape-shifting are discussed as well. Such types of so-called “sequential” shape-shifting enable achieving more complex 3D shapes, as the kinematics of the movements could be planned in time to avoid collisions. Ultimately, we discuss what 3D shapes could be achieved through shape-shifting from flat soft matter and identify multiple areas of application.},

abstract = {The concept of using stimuli-responsive hydrogels to actuate fluids in microfluidic devices is particularly attractive, but limitations, in terms of spatial resolution, speed, reliability and integration, have hindered its development during the past two decades. By patterning and grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) PNIPAM hydrogel films on plane substrates with a 2 $\mu$m horizontal resolution and closing the system afterward, we have succeeded in unblocking bottlenecks that thermo-sensitive hydrogel technology has been challenged with until now. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time with this technology, devices with up to 7800 actuated micro-cages that sequester and release solutes, along with valves actuated individually with closing and opening switching times of 0.6±0.1 and 0.25±0.15 s, respectively. Two applications of this technology are illustrated in the domain of single cell handling and the nuclear acid amplification test (NAAT) for the Human Synaptojanin 1 gene, which is suspected to be involved in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. The performance of the temperature-responsive hydrogels we demonstrate here suggests that in association with their moderate costs, hydrogels may represent an alternative to the actuation or handling techniques currently used in microfluidics, that are, pressure actuated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) valves and droplets. Building microfluidic devices with responsive hydrogels makes it easier to manipulate bioparticles without conventional silicone valves. The approach from Patrick Tabeling and Yvette Tran at ESPCI Paris, France, and colleagues use ultraviolet light to simultaneously graft, cross-link and pattern a temperature-responsive hydrogel called poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) onto flat substrates. Then, the system is sealed with an adhesive or silicone compound. By patterning the hydrogel into 3D squares a few micrometers in size, the researchers created a platform of 7800 cages that were capable of sequestering and releasing solutes on-demand with 100-millisecond-scale response times. The cages could be lowered to establish a microfluidic flow of cells over the device, and then raised to trap individual particles for high-throughput analysis. Successful amplification of the human gene synaptojanin-1, associated with Parkinson's disease, was also demonstrated.},

abstract = {Scientists are exploring elastic and soft forms of robots, electronic skin and energy harvesters, dreaming to mimic nature and to enable novel applications in wide fields, from consumer and mobile appliances to biomedical systems, sports and healthcare. All conceivable classes of materials with a wide range of mechanical, physical and chemical properties are employed, from liquids and gels to organic and inorganic solids. Functionalities never seen before are achieved. In this review we discuss soft robots which allow actuation with several degrees of freedom. We show that different actuation mechanisms lead to similar actuators, capable of complex and smooth movements in 3d space. We introduce latest research examples in sensor skin development and discuss ultraflexible electronic circuits, light emitting diodes and solar cells as examples. Additional functionalities of sensor skin, such as visual sensors inspired by animal eyes, camouflage, self-cleaning and healing and on-skin energy storage and generation are briefly reviewed. Finally, we discuss a paradigm change in energy harvesting, away from hard energy generators to soft ones based on dielectric elastomers. Such systems are shown to work with high energy of conversion, making them potentially interesting for harvesting mechanical energy from human gait, winds and ocean waves. Soft matter is in the focus of current materials research for the development of functional devices mimicking nature. The review focuses on soft robots, electronic skin and soft energy generators and storage elements. The image displays examples of soft devices, a robotic gripper, an electronic film that can be crumpled, a stretchable accumulator and an ultraflexible organic light emitting diode. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Actuation is an essential function of any artificial or living machine, allowing its movement and its interaction with the surrounding environment. Living muscles have evolved over millions of years within animals as nature's premier living generators of force, work and power, showing unique characteristics in comparison with standard artificial actuators. Current actuation technologies actually represent a real bottleneck in many robotics and ICT applications, including the bio-inspired ones. Main limitations involve inertia and backdrivability, stiffness control and power consumption. The development of novel actuators able to better mimic or even to overcome living muscle performances would open new horizons in robotics and ICT technologies: these components would allow the raise of a new generation of machines, with life-like movements and outstanding performances. An innovative solution to achieve this goal is represented by the merging between artificial and living entities, towards the realization of bio-hybrid devices. The aim of the present article is to describe the scientific and technological efforts made by researchers in the last two decades to achieve cell- or tissue-based actuators, with the dream of matching or outperforming natural muscles and to efficiently power micro- and mini-devices. The main challenges connected to the development of a cell-based actuator are highlighted and the most recent solutions to this scientific/technological problem are depicted, reporting advantages and drawbacks of each single approach. Future perspectives are also described, envisioning bio-hybrid actuators as key components of a new generation of machines able to show life-like movements and behaviors.},

abstract = {Soft robots possess many attributes that are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with conventional robots composed of rigid materials. Yet, despite recent advances, soft robots must still be tethered to hard robotic control systems and power sources. New strategies for creating completely soft robots, including soft analogues of these crucial components, are needed to realize their full potential. Here we report the untethered operation of a robot composed solely of soft materials. The robot is controlled with microfluidic logic11 that autonomously regulates fluid flow and, hence, catalytic decomposition of an on-board monopropellant fuel supply. Gas generated from the fuel decomposition inflates fluidic networks downstream of the reaction sites, resulting in actuation. The body and microfluidic logic of the robot are fabricated using moulding and soft lithography, respectively, and the pneumatic actuator networks, on-board fuel reservoirs and catalytic reaction chambers needed for movement are patterned within the body via a multi-material, embedded 3D printing technique. The fluidic and elastomeric architectures required for function span several orders of magnitude from the microscale to the macroscale. Our integrated design and rapid fabrication approach enables the programmable assembly of multiple materials within this architecture, laying the foundation for completely soft, autonomous robots.},

abstract = {We present a coevolutionary algorithm for inferring the topology and parameters of a wide range of hidden nonlinear systems with a minimum of experimentation on the target system. The algorithm synthesizes an explicit model directly from the observed data produced by intelligently generated tests. The algorithm is composed of two coevolving populations. One population evolves candidate models that estimate the structure of the hidden system. The second population evolves informative tests that either extract new information from the hidden system or elicit desirable behavior from it. The fitness of candidate models is their ability to explain behavior of the target system observed in response to all tests carried out so far; the fitness of candidate tests is their ability to make the models disagree in their predictions. We demonstrate the generality of this estimation-exploration algorithm by applying it to four different problems—grammar induction, gene network inference, evolutionary robotics, and robot damage recovery—and discuss how it overcomes several of the pathologies commonly found in other coevolutionary algorithms. We show that the algorithm is able to successfully infer and/or manipulate highly nonlinear hidden systems using very few tests, and that the benefit of this approach increases as the hidden systems possess more degrees of freedom, or become more biased or unobservable. The algorithm provides a systematic method for posing synthesis or analysis tasks to a coevolutionary system.},

abstract = {—The compliance of soft grippers contributes to their great superiority over rigid grippers in grasping irregularly shaped objects and forming soft contact with environments. Due to a rel-atively small pressure, soft grippers lack the stiffness required for wider applications. Particle jamming has been frequently re-ported as a means of stiffness control. Unlike previous research using vacuum for particle jamming, this paper proposes a novel passive particle jamming principle that does not need any vac-uum power or other control means. The proposed method is by simply patching a silicone rubber soft actuator and a pack (made of strain-limiting membrane) of particles to form an integral grip-ping finger. The inflation of the soft actuator applies a pressure to the particle pack causing particles inside it to jam. A larger squeez-ing pressure will result in tighter particle jamming, thus increasing the stiffness of the finger. The stiffness of the finger is controllable as it is proportional to the actuator's air pressure, which has been verified by experiments in this research. The stiffness can increase more than six fold when air pressure changes from 20 to 80 kPa in the experimental studies. The reported discovery may enhance the capabilities of soft robotic grippers so that more robotic picking operations could be performed by soft grippers.},

As a result, it was confirmed that the motions of the robot resemble those of the actual earthworm. Furthermore, the experimental results were obtained that there is an appropriate period for the peristaltic crawling motion of the robot, and the velocity tends to decrease with decreasing friction force, etc.},

We developed two types of actuators from inflatable pouches: the linear pouch motor and the rotational pouch motor. Our theoretical analysis predicts the static force-length and moment-angle relationships of these actuators under pressure control. We compare the theoretical bounds with actual results achieved using several fabricated devices.

abstract = {The biologic properties of the sponge‐like polymers of ethylene glycol methacrylate gels and their host compatibility have been verified in subcutaneous and intraperitoneal application in rats. All three sample types tested, with different porosities, have been tolerated very well with the receptor and have caused no pathologic reaction. Subcutaneous implants are directly integrated in teh organism, cellular immigration taking place with vascularization of the surface layer of the implantate to a depth of some 500 $\mu$ during the second week after implantation, causing the sponge to become an integral component of the surrounding tissues. More substantial differences in the reaction to the presence of implantates of different porosity ahve not been observed. These properties directly predetermine the sponge‐like polymers for wider application in plastic and reconstructive surgery. In addition, there is the possibility of utilizing them as an auxiliary surgical material, e.g., for drying and cleaning the operative field, or as operation towels. Good results have been achieved also in mechanically stopping bleeding from parenchymatose organs by application of the sponge foil. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1967 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

Then, the system is sealed with an adhesive or silicone compound. By patterning the hydrogel into 3D squares a few micrometers in size, the researchers created a platform of 7800 cages that were capable of sequestering and releasing solutes on-demand with 100-millisecond-scale response times.

Working with the Miura-ori tessellation, we find that each unit cell of this crease pattern is mechanically bistable, and by switching between states, the compressive modulus of the overall structure can be rationally and reversibly tuned. By virtue of their interactions, these mechanically stable lattice defects also lead to emergent crystallographic structures such as vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries. Each of these structures comes from an arrangement of reversible folds, highlighting a connection between mechanical metamaterials and programmable matter. Given origami's scale-free geometric character, this framework for metamaterial design can be directly transferred to milli-, micro-, and nanometer-size systems.},

However, strain sensors capable of wide-range force detection with adjustable modulus facilities are highly desirable to obtain mechanical feedback in various scenarios. Herein, a stretchable capacitive strain sensor capable of adjustable modulus and wide-range force detection is reported. The sensor consists of two liquid metals (LMs) filled thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) tubes encapsulated in flexible silicone. The adjustable modulus capability of the sensor is attained by mounting the sensor with springs of different elastic coefficients. During electromechanical tests, the elastic coefficient-dependent adjustable modulus is obtained in the range of 0.78–10.3 MPa. After optimizing the performance, a sensor capable of wide force-sensing range (0.07–74 N), high cyclic stability ({\textgreater}3500 cycles), with low hysteresis, good linearity, and fast response time ({\textless}50 ms) is achieved. Finally, a digital display system is developed to display the amount of detected force during the loading of the sensor, which confirms the great capability of the sensor to be applied in joint rehabilitation and soft robotic fields.},

abstract = {The field of active origami explores the incorporation of active materials into origami-inspired structures in order to serve as a means of actuation. Active origami-inspired structures capable of folding into complex three-dimensional (3D) shapes have the potential to be lightweight and versatile compared to traditional methods of actuation. This paper details the finite element analysis and experimental validation of unimorph actuators. Actuators are fabricated by adhering layers of electroded dielectric elastomer (3M VHB F9473PC) onto a passive substrate layer (3M Magic Scotch Tape). Finite element analysis of the actuators simulates the electromechanical coupling of the dielectric elastomer under an applied voltage by applying pressures to the surfaces of the dielectric elastomer where the compliant electrode (conductive carbon grease) is present. 3D finite element analysis of the bending actuators shows that applying contact boundary conditions to the electroded region of the active and passive layers provides better agreement to experimental data compared to modeling the entire actuator as continuous. To improve the applicability of dielectric elastomer-based actuators for active origami-inspired structures, folding actuators are developed by taking advantage of localized deformation caused by a passive layer with non-uniform thickness. Two-dimensional analysis of the folding actuators shows that agreement to experimental data diminishes as localized deformation increases. Limitations of using pressures to approximate the electromechanical coupling of the dielectric elastomer under an applied electric field and additional modeling considerations are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design of a unique revolute flexure joint, called a split-tube flexure, that enables (lumped compliance) compliant mechanism design with a consider- ably larger range-of-motion than a conventional thin beam flexure, and additionally provides significantly better multi-axis revolute joint characteristics. Conventional flexure joints utilize bending as the primary mechanism of deformation. In contrast, the split-tube flexure joint incorporates torsion as the primary mode of deformation, and contrasts the torsional properties of a thin-walled open-section member with the bending properties of that member to obtain desirable joint behavior. The development of this joint enables the development of compliant mechanisms that are quite compliant along kinematic axes, extremely stiff along structural axes„and are capable of kinematically well-behaved large motions.},

Combination of the GO nanosheets and thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymeric networks provides the hydrogels with an excellent NIR light-responsive property. The ultrahigh tensibility of PNIPAM-GO nanocomposite hydrogels is achieved by simply using a very low concentration of N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS) molecules as chemical cross-linkers to generate a relatively homogeneous structure with flexible long polymer chains and rare chemically cross-linked dense clusters. Moreover, the oxidized groups of GO nanosheets enable the formation of a hydrogen bond interaction with the amide groups of PNIPAM chains, which could physically cross-link the PNIPAM chains to increase the toughness of the hydrogel networks. The prepared PNIPAM-GO nanocomposite hydrogels with ultrahigh tensibility exhibit rapid, reversible, and repeatable NIR light-responsive properties, which are highly promising for fabricating remote light-controlled devices, smart actuators, artificial muscles, and so on.},

abstract = {The passive elasticity of muscle is largely governed by the I-band part of the giant muscle protein titin, a complex molecular spring composed of a series of individually folded immunoglobulin-like domains as well as largely unstructured unique sequences. These mechanical elements have distinct mechanical properties, and when combined, they provide the desired passive elastic properties of muscle, which are a unique combination of strength, extensibility and resilience. Single-molecule atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies demonstrated that the macroscopic behaviour of titin in intact myofibrils can be reconstituted by combining the mechanical properties of these mechanical elements measured at the single-molecule level. Here we report artificial elastomeric proteins that mimic the molecular architecture of titin through the combination of well-characterized protein domains GB1 and resilin. We show that these artificial elastomeric proteins can be photochemically crosslinked and cast into solid biomaterials. These biomaterials behave as rubber-like materials showing high resilience at low strain and as shock-absorber-like materials at high strain by effectively dissipating energy. These properties are comparable to the passive elastic properties of muscles within the physiological range of sarcomere length and so these materials represent a new muscle-mimetic biomaterial. The mechanical properties of these biomaterials can be fine-tuned by adjusting the composition of the elastomeric proteins, providing the opportunity to develop biomaterials that are mimetic of different types of muscles. We anticipate that these biomaterials will find applications in tissue engineering as scaffold and matrix for artificial muscles.},

abstract = {The sarcomere of muscle is composed of tens of thousands of myosin motors that self-assemble into thick filaments and interact with surrounding actin-based thin filaments in a dense, near-crystalline hexagonal lattice. Together, these actin-myosin interactions enable large-scale movement and force generation, two primary attributes of muscle. Research on isolated fibres has provided considerable insight into the collective properties of muscle, but how actin-myosin interactions are coordinated in an ensemble remains poorly understood. Here, we show that artificial myosin filaments, engineered using a DNA nanotube scaffold, provide precise control over motor number, type and spacing. Using both dimeric myosin V- and myosin VI-labelled nanotubes, we find that neither myosin density nor spacing has a significant effect on the gliding speed of actin filaments. This observation supports a simple model of myosin ensembles as energy reservoirs that buffer individual stochastic events to bring about smooth, continuous motion. Furthermore, gliding speed increases with cross-bridge compliance, but is limited by Brownian effects. As a first step to reconstituting muscle motility, we demonstrate human $\beta$-cardiac myosin-driven gliding of actin filaments on DNA nanotubes.},

Although a variety of manipulators enabled by different mechanism have been developed, few of them can preserve softness, thinness, and decent bending capability simultaneously. In this letter, we present a miniature soft robotic manipulator made of hyper-elastic silicone rubber. Along with the manipulator design, two novel fabrication methods are proposed and elaborated. Detailed characterizations are specified to show the bending capability of the manipulator given different air pressure. Specifically, our manipulator, as thin as 6 mm, is able to achieve 360° directional bending, and, when given pressure over 70 kPa, it can reach 180° bending angle and around 5 mm bending radius easily. Due to its innate compliance and small dimension, this type of robotic manipulator can deliver safe and comfortable interactions with the subjects. More significantly, the novel fabrications in this letter diversify the fabrication methods for soft pneumatic robots and actuators (SPRA) and further scale down their sizes.},

The undulated locomotion of the segmented body in the annelid is characterized by the combination of individual motion of the muscles distributed along the body, which has been of keen interest in biomimetic investigation. In this paper, we present an annelid-like robot driven by soft actuators based on dielectric elastomer. To mimic the unique motion of the annelid, a novel actuation method employing dielectric elastomer is developed. By using the actuator, a three-degree-of-freedom actuator module is presented, which can provide up–down translational motion, and two rotational degree-of-freedom motion. The proposed actuation method provides advantageous features of reduction in size, fast response and ruggedness in operation. By serially connecting the actuator modules, a micro-robot mimicking the motion of the annelid is developed and its effectiveness is experimentally demonstrated.

abstract = {We make a thorough kinematic comparison of forward and backward swimming and maneuvering on a self-propelled robot platform that uses sub-carangiform swimming as the primary propulsor. An improved Central Pattern Generator (CPG) model allowing free adjustment of phase relationship and directional bias is employed to achieve flexible swimming and smooth transition. Considering the characteristics of forward swimming in carangiform fish and backward swimming in anguilliform fish, various backward swimming patterns for the sub-carangiform robotic fish are suitably created by reversing the direction of propagating propulsive waves. Through a combined use of the CPG control and closed-loop swimming direction control strategy, flexible and precise turning maneuvers in both forward and backward swimming are implemented and compared. By contrast with forward swimming, backward swimming requires a higher frequency or an increased lateral displacement to reach the same relative swimming speed. Noticeably, the phase difference shows a greater impact on forward swimming than on backward swimming. Our observations also indicate that the robotic fish achieves a larger turning rate in forward maneuvering than in backward maneuvering, yet these two maneuvers display comparable turning precision. {\textcopyright}2014 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Most natural (or biological) materials are complex composites whose mechanical properties are often outstanding, considering the weak constituents from which they are assembled. These complex structures, which have risen from hundreds of million years of evolution, are inspiring Materials Scientists in the design of novel materials. Their defining characteristics, hierarchy, multifunctionality, and self-healing capability, are illustrated. Self-organization is also a fundamental feature of many biological materials and the manner by which the structures are assembled from the molecular level up. The basic building blocks are described, starting with the 20 amino acids and proceeding to polypeptides, polysaccharides, and polypeptides-saccharides. These, on their turn, compose the basic proteins, which are the primary constituents of 'soft tissues' and are also present in most biominerals. There are over 1000 proteins, and we describe only the principal ones, with emphasis on collagen, chitin, keratin, and elastin. The 'hard' phases are primarily strengthened by minerals, which nucleate and grow in a biomediated environment that determines the size, shape and distribution of individual crystals. The most important mineral phases are discussed: hydroxyapatite, silica, and aragonite. Using the classification of Wegst and Ashby, the principal mechanical characteristics and structures of biological ceramics, polymer composites, elastomers, and cellular materials are presented. Selected systems in each class are described with emphasis on the relationship between their structure and mechanical response. A fifth class is added to this: functional biological materials, which have a structure developed for a specific function: adhesion, optical properties, etc. An outgrowth of this effort is the search for bioinspired materials and structures. Traditional approaches focus on design methodologies of biological materials using conventional synthetic materials. The new frontiers reside in the synthesis of bioinspired materials through processes that are characteristic of biological systems; these involve nanoscale self-assembly of the components and the development of hierarchical structures. Although this approach is still in its infancy, it will eventually lead to a plethora of new materials systems as we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of growth and the structure of biological systems. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Three peripheral bobbins were machined in the cylinder around which three coils have been wound. An iron-core can easily move inside the bore. One of the coils acts as primary and the other two are secondary coils. Change in the position of the core due to surface peaks and valleys causes-the induced voltage in the secondary coils to vary. This change in the voltage is a measure of core position and reveals the morphological features of the surface (surface profile). Experiments show that the proposed sensor is capable of discriminating between the models of two different types of skin lesions, namely, anetoderma and nodule, which resemble each other in visual inspection but behave differently when being touched. Thus, this sensor could be used as an assist device for diagnosis purposes in teledermatology systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Science Publications.},

The compression deformation energy of 50{\%} reduction of its original size increased monotonically, while the hysteresis loss was not affected by T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}gel{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. To understand these macroscopic properties, the network structures of the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared measurements. As a result, the size of the microcrystallites increased with an increase in T{\textless}inf{\textgreater}gel{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the average distance between the microcrystallites also increased. These results suggested that the structures of PVA networks, crosslinked by the microcrystallites, have essential roles in determining the mechanical properties of PVA cast gels. The macroscopic mechanical properties are discussed on the basis of the size, number, and distribution of microcrystallites as crosslinkers and the homogeneity of amorphous PVA networks, which were determined at gelation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {A remarkably diverse group of organisms rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support, movement, muscular antagonism and the amplification of the force and displacement of muscle contraction. In hydrostatic skeletons, force is transmitted not through rigid skeletal elements but instead by internal pressure. Functioning of these systems depends on the fact that they are essentially constant in volume as they consist of relatively incompressible fluids and tissue. Contraction of muscle and the resulting decrease in one of the dimensions thus results in an increase in another dimension. By actively (with muscle) or passively (with connective tissue) controlling the various dimensions, a wide array of deformations, movements and changes in stiffness can be created. An amazing range of animals and animal structures rely on this form of skeletal support, including anemones and other polyps, the extremely diverse wormlike invertebrates, the tube feet of echinoderms, mammalian and turtle penises, the feet of burrowing bivalves and snails, and the legs of spiders. In addition, there are structures such as the arms and tentacles of cephalopods, the tongue of mammals and the trunk of the elephant that also rely on hydrostatic skeletal support but lack the fluid-filled cavities that characterize this skeletal type. Although we normally consider arthropods to rely on a rigid exoskeleton, a hydrostatic skeleton provides skeletal support immediately following molting and also during the larval stage for many insects. Thus, the majority of animals on earth rely on hydrostatic skeletons.},

For verification purpose, a few numerical results obtained by the proposed approach are compared with existing experimental data and analytical solutions. They are all in good agreement.

abstract = {Insects are a constant source of inspiration for roboticists. Their compliant bodies allow them to squeeze through small openings and be highly resilient to impacts. However, making subgram autonomous soft robots untethered and capable of responding intelligently to the environment is a long-standing challenge. One obstacle is the low power density of soft actuators, leading to small robots unable to carry their sense and control electronics and a power supply. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), a class of electrostatic electroactive polymers, allow for kilohertz operation with high power density but require typically several kilovolts to reach full strain. The mass of kilovolt supplies has limited DEA robot speed and performance. In this work, we report low-voltage stacked DEAs (LVSDEAs) with an operating voltage below 450 volts and used them to propel an insect-sized (40 millimeters long) soft untethered and autonomous legged robot. The DEAnsect body, with three LVSDEAs to drive its three legs, weighs 190 milligrams and can carry a 950-milligram payload (five times its body weight). The unloaded DEAnsect moves at 30 millimeters/second and is very robust by virtue of its compliance. The sub-500-volt operation voltage enabled us to develop 780-milligram drive electronics, including optical sensors, a microcontroller, and a battery, for two channels to output 450 volts with frequencies up to 1 kilohertz. By integrating this flexible printed circuit board with the DEAnsect, we developed a subgram robot capable of autonomous navigation, independently following printed paths. This work paves the way for new generations of resilient soft and fast untethered robots.},

abstract = {Among the various behaviors in higher plants, a peculiar one, that a part of the leaf or flower in certain plants shows very rapid movement upon stimulus, has invited the attention of a number of investigators since the beginning of botanical research. However, in spite of this long history of study, numerous fundamental aspects of the phenomena remain to be clari­ fied. Since the definition of the rapid movement is still unclear, discussion in this review will be restricted to three types of the movements: (a) rapid response in the pulvini of the mimosas; (b) shutting movement in the traps of two carnivores, Dionaea and Aldrovanda (an aquatic plant); and (c) visible movements in the stamen and pistil of some plants upon stimulus. This review is not intended to be a comprehensive resume of all published works on the movements. I intend to restrict my discussion to a consider­ ation of various results in an attempt to discover a general mechanism un­ derlying these movements, and will stress the relation between electrical re­ sponse and the movement. Several reviews and monographs have been published that approach this problem from various points of view (18, 19, 24, 42, 101, 103), including the author's own works (11, 71). In this review I will return to some of the important older literature which provides a basis for understanding the mechanism.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new method for the control of soft robots with elastic behavior, piloted by several actuators. The central contribution of this work is the use of the Finite Element Method (FEM), computed in real-time, in the control algorithm. The FEM based simulation computes the nonlinear deformations of the robots at interactive rates. The model is completed by Lagrange multipliers at the actuation zones and at the end-effector position. A reduced compliance matrix is built in order to deal with the necessary inversion of the model. Then, an iterative algorithm uses this compliance matrix to find the contribution of the actuators (force and/or position) that will deform the structure so that the terminal end of the robot follows a given position. Additional constraints, like rigid or deformable obstacles, or the internal characteristics of the actuators are integrated in the control algorithm. We illustrate our method using simulated examples of both serial and parallel structures and we validate it on a real 3D soft robot made of silicone.},

abstract = {Soft robots are machines, and like all machines their function is to convert energy from one form into another to perform tasks. One key figure of merit for machines is their efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of task-oriented work out to total energy in. All soft robots convert stored energy (from e.g., batteries, pressurized gas, chemicals) into task-oriented work (picking up objects, locomoting, jumping). These systems are complex hybrids of chemical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electrical components. This complexity makes it difficult to analyze and measure their total efficiency and to identify the sources of energy loss between chemical, electrical, and mechanical domains. As the field of soft robotics matures, the design-flow process will shift from one in which building is central to one in which simulation takes precedence. That is, there is a shift from an empirical experimental methodology toward a well-characterized engineering workflow. At this point, questions such as ''For how long will this robot run on a 2000 mAh battery?'' will need to be answered, and predictive capabilities will become paramount as designers need to understand: (1) the large-scale deformations inherent to soft robotic systems; and (2) the transduction of energy in these complex, dissipative, systems to enable them to design an efficient and a well-controlled system. In this perspective piece, we discuss one possible predictive approach: a framework that uses port-based modeling. This approach uses bond-graphs and the recently developed port-Hamiltonian theory to provide a step-by-step system for analyzing hybrid, multi-domain, soft robotic systems. We discuss how this framework could be applied to controlling and optimizing soft robotic systems for energy efficiency, thereby increasing their utility. An energy-based approach is useful as a domain-free linker in analyzing complex systems; the use of ports promotes a clear distinction between energy conservation and dissipation and facilitates the analysis of efficiency. In addition, the parallels with hardware description languages and object-oriented programming will make it easier for engineers to design, for soft robots, control systems that optimize for efficiency.},

This hybrid structure enables actuation of the microrobot with independent driving of multiple actuators to provide complex movement like that of living microorganisms. We use the temperature-responsive hydrogel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) as a soft microactuator. PNIPAAm swells with water at low temperature but shrinks at high temperature. This volume change thus allows PNIPAAm to be used as an actuator by controlling its temperature. We successfully fabricated the microrobot with its soft-rigid hybrid structure composed of PNIPAAm and rigid photoresist using a multilayered microfabrication process. In addition, we used a sacrificial layer process to release the fabricated microrobot from the substrate to allow it to move freely. To actuate the microrobot, we mixed PNIPAAm with graphene, which has a high photothermal conversion efficiency. The temperature of the soft actuator when mixed with graphene can be increased by irradiating it with light. Therefore, actuation of the microrobot is achieved by sequentially irradiating the microactuators with focused light. We present the fabrication, release and partial actuation of the microrobot to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed microrobot with the soft-rigid hybrid structure in this paper.},

However, the 21st century's robotic legacy may very well become that of soft robots. This emerging domain is characterized by continuous soft structures that simultaneously fulfill the role of robotic link and actuator, where prime focus is on design and fabrication of robotic hardware instead of software control. These robots are anticipated to take a prominent role in delicate tasks where classic robots fail, such as in minimally invasive surgery, active prosthetics, and automation tasks involving delicate irregular objects. Central to the development of these robots is the fabrication of soft actuators. This article reviews a particularly attractive type of soft actuators that are driven by pressurized fluids. These actuators have recently gained traction on the one hand due to the technology push from better simulation tools and new manufacturing technologies, and on the other hand by a market pull from applications. This paper provides an overview of the different advanced soft actuator configurations, their design, fabrication, and applications.},

abstract = {Soft robot arms possess unique capabilities when it comes to adaptability, flexibility, and dexterity. In addition, soft systems that are pneumatically actuated can claim high power-to-weight ratio. One of the main drawbacks of pneumatically actuated soft arms is that their stiffness cannot be varied independently from their end-effector position in space. The novel robot arm physical design presented in this article successfully decouples its end-effector positioning from its stiffness. An experimental characterization of this ability is coupled with a mathematical analysis. The arm combines the light weight, high payload to weight ratio and robustness of pneumatic actuation with the adaptability and versatility of variable stiffness. Light weight is a vital component of the inherent safety approach to physical human-robot interaction. To characterize the arm, a neural network analysis of the curvature of the arm for different input pressures is performed. The curvature-pressure rela-tionship is also characterized experimentally.},

abstract = {Four types of three-dimensional (3-D) metallic metamaterials with tailorable thermo-mechanical properties are designed. For the first three types, the structure-property relations are studied by adjusting design parameters including two length parameters, one angle parameter and two material combinations. For the fourth type, one additional angle parameter is involved. It is shown that each of the four types of metamaterials designed exhibits the cubic symmetry and thus needs three independent elastic constants to characterize its elastic behavior and one coefficient of thermal expansion to describe its isotropic thermal expansion. The effects of the design parameters on the effective Poisson's ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus, shear modulus and the relative density are systematically investigated for each of the four types of designed metamaterials by using unit cell-based finite element simulations that incorporate periodic boundary conditions. It is found that 3-D metallic metamaterials with positive, near-zero or negative PR and CTE can be obtained by tailoring the bi-material lattice structures and material combinations. Also, it is revealed that metamaterial {\#} 1 can achieve both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE while maintaining a high stiffness and a low relative density (and thus a lightweight). The good tunability of thermo-mechanical properties of the four types of metamaterials provides an avenue of enabling the expansion of Ashby's material chart to produce more material options for engineering applications.},

We identify energy density (joules/gram) and flow capacity (liters/gram) normalized by the mass of the entire fuel system (versus net fuel mass) as key metrics for soft robotic power systems.

abstract = {Robots that are not only robust, dynamic, and gentle in the human ro-bot interaction, but are also able to perform precise and repeatable movements, need accurate dynamics modeling and a high-performance closed-loop control. As a technological basis we propose robots with intrinsically compliant joints, a stiff link structure, and a soft shell. The flexible joints are driven by Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) with a mechanical spring coupling between the motor and the ac-tuator output and the ability to change the mechanical stiffness of the spring cou-pling. Several model based and model free control approaches have been devel-oped for this technology, e.g. Cartesian stiffness control, optimal control, reactions, reflexes, and cyclic motion control. 20.1 Introduction Robots interacting with humans in direct physical contact or even acting in place of a human in given situations are of high interest for current research. Manipulat-ing objects in direct contact with the human or in unstructured environment likely results in contacts and collisions that are unpredictable. Furthermore, the desired robot skills include fine manipulation as well as highly dynamic and powerful movements.

abstract = {Freshwater stingrays undulate their flexible disc-like pectoral fins to perform cruising, manoeuvring, and other motions. This undulatory propulsion has a higher propulsive efficiency and more precise manoeuvrability than most other species at low swimming velocity. In the current study, a new robotic fish inspired by the freshwater stingray was developed and tested. First, the morphology and kinematic patterns of the freshwater stingray were presented. A kinematic model of the pectoral fin was established based on several assumptions. Then a robotic stingray with an undulatory pectoral fin was designed and developed. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of various fin actuation parameters on its linear swimming velocity and the forces generated by the robotic stingray. The controllable fin parameters include oscillation frequency, wave number, maximal angular deflection of the fin rays, and the amplitude pattern of the pectoral fin. The experimental results indicate that the developed prototype is able to generate adequate thrust for self-propulsion. Linear swimming velocity and surge force increase rapidly with oscillation frequency, angular deflection, and wave number. A maximum velocity of 4.3 cm??s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (nearly 0.18 Body Lengths per second (BL??s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})) and a maximum surge force of 102 mN are achieved at an oscillation frequency of 0.5 Hz, a wave number of 1, a maximum angular deflection of 30??, and an equal amplitude pattern. The sway force of the robotic fish fluctuates around 0 mN. The heave force varies with wave number and reaches its minimum at a wave number of 1.},

Over millions of years in a vast and often hostile realm, fish have evolved swimming capabilities far superior in many ways to what has been achieved by nautical technology. Instinctively, they use their superbly streamlined bodies to exploit fluid-mechanical principles, achieving extraordinary propulsion efficiencies, acceleration and manoeuvrability. Their solutions achieved the best performances based on aspects like preys hunting and living conditions. Looking at nature for inspiration as to how design an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle can significantly improve its flexibility and efficiency. This paper presents an examination of the state of the art on biomimetic robotic fishes, underlining the reasons why bio-inspiration can be a winning move and discussing how fish swimming can be the line of sight of the future locomotion technology. The paper concludes with a novel mechanism proposal, designed to produce optimal oscillatory motion between the flexible parts constituting the hull of the robotic fish.},

Steerable or flexible bevel-tip needles have an asymmetric tip that causes the needle to bend, and needles can reach the target by deflection over insertion. Getting feedback from imaging devices can improve the objectives. In 2D motion planning it is so important to keep and stabilize the needle in a desired plan. Since the tissue type changes during insertion that causes uncertainty parameter so it is a big problem to keep the needle in the desired plan. In this paper we propose a robust controller with the H-infinity output feedback approach to overcome the uncertainty and disturbances. This controller is applied to a linearized model of steerable needles. Simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the scheme.},

This paper presents a comparative study for actuation by undulation in water. We focus on actuating a 1DOF systems with several mechanisms. A hydraulic pump attached to a soft body allows for water movement between two inner cavities, ultimately leading to a flexing actuation in a side-to-side manner. The effectiveness of six different, self-contained designs based on centrifugal pump, flexible impeller pump, external gear pump and rotating valves are compared. These hydraulic actuation systems combined with soft test bodies were then measured at a lower and higher oscillation frequency. The deflection characteristics of the soft body, the acoustic noise of the pump and the overall efficiency of the system are recorded. A brushless, centrifugal pump combined with a novel rotating valve performed at both test frequencies as the most efficient pump, producing sufficiently large cyclic body deflections along with the least acoustic noise among all pumps tested. An external gear pump design produced the largest body deflection, but consumes an order of magnitude more power and produced high noise levels. Further refinement remains on determining the suitable oscillation frequencies and inner cavity designs for optimal efficiency and movement.},

abstract = {The modulation of the swelling ability of the hydrogel matrix by pH-stimulus enables the dynamic control of the swelling forces, thereby obtaining effective diffusivity and permeability of the solutes, or mechanical energy from the hydrogel. In this work, a chemo-electro-mechanical model describing hydrogel behavior, based on multi-field effects, is developed to simulate the swelling and shrinking of these fascinating bio-materials, and it is termed the multi-effect-coupling pH-stimulus (MECpH) model. This model accounts for the ionic fluxes within both the hydrogel and solution, the coupling between the electric field, ionic fluxes, and mechanical deformations of the hydrogel. The main contribution of this model is to incorporate the relationship between the concentrations of the ionized fixed-charge groups and the diffusive hydrogen ion, which follows a Langmuir isotherm, into the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system. To validate this MECpH model, one-dimensional steady-state simulations under varying pH solution are carried out via a meshless Hermite-Cloud methodology, and the numerical results are compared with available experimental data. It is shown that the presently developed MECpH model is accurate, efficient, and numerically stable.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in voxelated matter that is designed and fabricated voxel by voxel1–4. Currently, inkjet-based three-dimensional (3D) printing is the only widely adopted method that is capable of creating 3D voxelated materials with high precision1–4, but the physics of droplet formation requires the use of low-viscosity inks to ensure successful printing5. By contrast, direct ink writing, an extrusion-based 3D printing method, is capable of patterning a much broader range of materials6–13. However, it is difficult to generate multimaterial voxelated matter by extruding monolithic cylindrical filaments in a layer-by-layer manner. Here we report the design and fabrication of voxelated soft matter using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing, in which the composition, function and structure of the materials are programmed at the voxel scale. Our MM3D printheads exploit the diode-like behaviour that arises when multiple viscoelastic materials converge at a junction to enable seamless, high-frequency switching between up to eight different materials to create voxels with a volume approaching that of the nozzle diameter cubed. As exemplars, we fabricate a Miura origami pattern14 and a millipede-like soft robot that locomotes by co-printing multiple epoxy and silicone elastomer inks of stiffness varying by several orders of magnitude. Our method substantially broadens the palette of voxelated materials that can be designed and manufactured in complex motifs.},

abstract = {It was established at SoCG'99 that every polyhedral complex can be folded from a sufficiently large square of paper, but the known algorithms are extremely impractical, wasting most of the material and making folds through many layers of paper. At a deeper level, these foldings get the topology wrong, introducing many gaps (boundaries) in the surface, which results in flimsy foldings in practice. We develop a new algorithm designed specifically for the practical folding of real paper into complicated polyhedral models. We prove that the algorithm correctly folds any oriented polyhedral manifold, plus an arbitrarily small amount of additional structure on one side of the surface (so for closed manifolds, inside the model). This algorithm is the first to attain the watertight property: for a specified cutting of the manifold into a topological disk with boundary, the folding maps the boundary of the paper to within $\epsilon$ of the specified boundary of the surface (in Fr{\'{e}}chet distance). Our foldings also have the geometric feature that every convex face is folded seamlessly, i.e., as one unfolded convex polygon of the piece of paper. This work provides the theoretical underpinnings for Origamizer, freely available software written by the second author, which has enabled practical folding of many complex polyhedral models such as the Stanford bunny.},

abstract = {In this paper a comprehensive methodology and simulation framework will be reviewed, designed in order to study the emergence of adaptive and intelligent behavior in generic soft-bodied creatures. By incorporating artificial evolutionary and developmental processes, the system allows to evolve complete creatures (brain, body, developmental properties, sensory and control system, etc.) for different task environments. Whether the evolved creatures will resemble animals or plants is in general not known a priori, and depends on the specific task environment set up by the experimenter. In this regard, the system may offer a unique opportunity to explore differences and similarities between these two worlds. Different material properties can be simulated and optimized, from a continuum of soft/stiff materials, to the interconnection of heterogeneous structures, both found in animals and plants alike. The adopted genetic encoding and simulation environment are particularly suitable in order to evolve distributed sensory and control systems, which play a particularly important role in plants. After a general description of the system some case studies will be presented, focusing on the emergent properties of the evolved creatures. Particular emphasis will be on some unifying concepts that are thought to play an important role in the emergence of intelligent and adaptive behavior across both the animal and plant kingdoms, such as morphological computation and morphological developmental plasticity. Overall, with this paper we hope to draw attention on set of tools, methodologies, ideas and results which may be relevant to researchers interested in plant-inspired robotics and intelligence.},

The proposed manipulator is based on a series of identical modules, each one consisting of a silicone tube with pneumatic chambers for allowing 3D motion and one central channel for the implementation of the granular jamming phenomenon for stiffening. The silicone is covered by a novel bellows-shaped braided structure maximizing the bending still limiting lateral expansion. In this paper one single module is tested in terms of bending range, elongation capability, generated forces and stiffness changing.},

abstract = {Stimuli-responsive hydrogels can sense environmental cues and change their volume accordingly without the need for additional sensors or actuators. This enables a significant reduction in the size and complexity of resulting devices. However, since the responsive volume change of hydrogels is typically uniform, their robotic applications requiring localized and time-varying deformations have been challenging to realize. Here, using addressable and tunable hydrogel building blocks—referred to as soft voxel actuators (SVAs)—heterogeneous hydrogel structures with programmable spatiotemporal deformations are presented. SVAs are produced using a mixed-solvent photopolymerization method, utilizing a fast reaction speed and the cononsolvency property of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) to produce highly interconnected hydrogel pore structures, resulting in tunable swelling ratio, swelling rate, and Young's modulus in a simple, one-step casting process that is compatible with mass production of SVA units. By designing the location and swelling properties of each voxel and by activating embedded Joule heaters in the voxels, spatiotemporal deformations are achieved, which enables heterogeneous hydrogel structures to manipulate objects, avoid obstacles, generate traveling waves, and morph to different shapes. Together, these innovations pave the way toward tunable, untethered, and high-degree-of-freedom hydrogel robots that can adapt and respond to changing conditions in unstructured environments.},

The arch-shaped robot is made up of liquid crystal elastomer–carbon nanotube composite. When a light source with a power intensity of around 1.57 W cm−2 is scanned over the surface of the robot, it deforms and crawls forward. With an increase in the light scanning speed, it can deform sufficiently to pass through a channel 25{\%} lower than its body height. Subjected to light irradiation, it can also deform to a closed loop, gradually store elastic energy, and suddenly release it to jump over a wall or onto a step quickly, with a jumping distance around eight times its body length and jumping height around five times its body height. Mathematical models for quantitatively understanding the multimodal locomotion of this light-powered soft robot are also presented.},

This question is considered here by first examining nature's solutions to this design problem and then discussing the structure, actuation mechanism, applications, and limitations of recently developed artificial muscles, including highly oriented semicrystalline polymer fibers; nanocomposite actuators; twisted nanofiber yarns; thermally activated shape-memory alloys; ionic-polymer/metal composites; dielectric-elastomer actuators; conducting polymers; stimuli-responsive gels; piezoelectric, electrostrictive, magnetostrictive, and photostrictive actuators; photoexcited actuators; electrostatic actuators; and pneumatic actuators. Artificial muscles are muscle-like actuators that contract, bend, or twist in response to an external stimulus. Recent advances in nanotechnology and microsystems have enabled a new class of materials suitable for artificial-muscle application. Different types of artificial muscle, including the recently invented actuators, are introduced and their applications and limitations are discussed.},

abstract = {Many environmental conditions can influence the mechanical characteristics of the glucose-sensitive hydrogels. In this paper, a multi-effect-coupling glucose-stimulus (MECglu) model is developed to study the influence of environmental solution pH on the swelling behavior of soft smart hydrogels responding to change in surrounding blood glucose concentration. In order to characterize the chemo-electro-mechanical behaviors of the hydrogels, the model is composed of the Nernst-Planck type of diffusion-reaction partial differential equations for mobile species with consideration of the enzyme reaction catalyzed by the glucose oxidase and the catalase, the Poisson equation for electric potential, and the nonlinear equilibrium equation for mechanical large deformation of the glucose-sensitive hydrogel. In the MECglu model, the formulation of the fixed charge groups bound onto the corsslinked polymeric network is associated with the change of the ambient solution pH. Using these nonlinear coupled partial differential equations, we demonstrate that the computational mechanical deformation by the MECglu model consists well with the experimental observations published in the range of practical physiological glucose concentration from 0 to 16.5 mm (300 mg/ml). The simulations are also carried out for analysis of the influences of physiological pH on the distributive profiles of reacting and diffusive species concentrations and the electric potential as well as the mechanical deformation of the glucose-sensitive hydrogels. The simulations by the model can efficiently support the design and optimization of the insulin delivery system based on the glucose-sensitive hydrogels with the immobilized glucose oxidase and catalase. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are found in mobile robots, assistive wearable devices, and rehabilitative technologies. While soft actuators have been one of the most crucial elements of technology leading the development of the soft robotics field, they fall short of force output and bandwidth requirements for many tasks. In addition, other general problems remain open, including robustness, controllability, and repeatability. The SPA-pack architecture presented here aims to satisfy these standards of reliability crucial to the field of soft robotics, while also improving the basic performance capabilities of SPAs by borrowing advantages leveraged ubiquitously in biology; namely, the structured parallel arrangement of lower power actuators to form the basis of a larger and more powerful actuator module. An SPA-pack module consisting of a number of smaller SPAs will be studied using an analytical model and physical prototype. Experimental measurements show an SPA pack to generate over 112 N linear force, while the model indicates the benefit of parallel actuator grouping over a geometrically equivalent single SPA scale as an increasing function of the number of individual actuators in the group. For a module of four actuators, a 23{\%} increase in force production over a volumetrically equivalent single SPA is predicted and validated, while further gains appear possible up to 50{\%}. These findings affirm the advantage of utilizing a fascicle structure for high-performance soft robotic applications over existing monolithic SPA designs. An example of high-performance soft robotic platform will be presented to demonstrate the capability of SPA-pack modules in a complete and functional system.},

Here, a humidity responsiveness of hydrogel film fabricated by the photopolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) monomer is reported. This kind of film could be driven by a small humidity gradient, thus spontaneous deformation and motion can be achieved by placing the film onto a moist filter paper. The influence factors of humidity response sensitivity such as the exposure time and number-average molecular weight of PEG-DA monomer used during the fabrication are investigated. Under different relative humidity, the film displays different degrees of pink color and the intensities of fluorescence under 365 nm illumination are also different, which renders the film to be used as a “humidity test strip.” A humidity-driven walking device is fabricated and the walking velocity is about 3 mm min −1  under the actuating water vapor. Vapor of volatile polar solvents could also drive the actuator to achieve fast deformation and shows the variety of the film responsivity.},

abstract = {Piezoresistive strain sensors dominate the field of soft elastomer sensors, with many interesting findings and applications. Nevertheless, the methods of characterizing the performance of the sensor differ in each study, leading to different conclusions and making comparison of the different sensor systems challenging. In this Review, the most important methods for characterization of the sensor response are being presented and some cases of elastomer strain sensors are being highlighted. Furthermore, the different materials options for elastomer strain sensors are shown, with special sections for the rapidly growing fields of additive manufacturing and 3D printing. In addition to the material choices and testing methods, different applications of strain sensors are presented. From the biomedical field, these soft sensors find applications in wearable devices, vital sign monitoring, and rehabilitation assistive devices. In soft robotics, they can be used in monitoring and controlling the function of soft robot and actuation systems, a function that can aid with feedback control, increasing the efficiency of the robot's function. Last but not least, in combination with the emerging self-healing materials, elastomer strain sensors can be used for monitoring the integrity of materials and structures.},

abstract = {Scaffolding-initially simplifying the task environment of autonomous robots-has been shown to increase the probability of evolving robots capable of performing in more complex task environments. Recently, it has been shown that changes to the body of a robot may also scaffold the evolution of non trivial behavior. This raises the question of whether two different kinds of scaffolding (environmental and morphological) synergize with one another when combined. Here it is shown that, for legged robots evolved to perform phototaxis, synergy can be achieved, but only if morphological and environmental scaffolding are combined in a particular way: The robots must first undergo morphological scaffolding, followed by environmental scaffolding. This suggests that additional kinds of scaffolding may create additional synergies that lead to the evolution of increasingly complex robot behaviors.},

abstract = {TSG101 and ALIX both function in HIV budding and in vesicle formation at the multivesicular body (MVB), where they interact with other Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) pathway factors required for release of viruses and vesicles. Proteomic analyses revealed that ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I also bind a series of proteins involved in cytokinesis, including CEP55, CD2AP, ROCK1, and IQGAP1. ALIX and TSG101 concentrate at centrosomes and are then recruited to the midbodies of dividing cells through direct interactions between the central CEP55 'hinge' region and GPP-based motifs within TSG101 and ALIX. ESCRT-III and VPS4 proteins are also recruited, indicating that much of the ESCRT pathway localizes to the midbody. Depletion of ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I inhibits the abscission step of HeLa cell cytokinesis, as does VPS4 overexpression, confirming a requirement for these proteins in cell division. Furthermore, ALIX point mutants that block CEP55 and CHMP4/ESCRT-III binding also inhibit abscission, indicating that both interactions are essential. These experiments suggest that the ESCRT pathway may be recruited to facilitate analogous membrane fission events during HIV budding, MVB vesicle formation, and the abscission stage of cytokinesis.},

Many researchers have proposed algorithmic improvements, but none have taken hold and greatly propelled the scalability of early works. This paper suggests a more fundamental problem with co-evolving both the morphology and control of virtual creatures simul-taneously – one cemented in the theory of embodied cogni-tion. We reproduce and explore in greater detail a previous finding in the literature: premature convergence of the mor-phology (compared to the convergence point of optimizing controllers), and discuss how this finding fits as a symptom of the proposed problem. We hope that this improved under-standing of the fundamental problem domain will open the door for further scalability of evolved agents, and note that early findings from our future work point in that direction.},

abstract = {The mechanism of variation of mass and volume, through the absorption of water, by the most commonly used and abundantly available spherical hydrogel beads of various colours has been studied. Immersing the beads in distilled water, both mass and volume were measured at regular intervals. By an analysis of mass-versus-time data, using standard theoretical methods, the mechanism of diffusion of water has been studied. Relaxation controlled transport was found to be the predominant process of diffusion of water into the materials under study. The diffusion coefficient has been determined for hydrogels of different colours. Various swelling related parameters such as equilibrium water content, equilibrium swelling ratio, characteristic time, initial rate of water absorption etc. were determined for these hydrogels. The maximum attainable mass and the maximum number water molecules that can be attached to active polymer sites in a single bead have been calculated. In this regard, the number of such active sites per unit volume and mass of dry hydrogel was determined. A theoretical model has been developed, based on the consideration of water absorption through the occupation of vacant polymer sites in a highly porous hydrogel. Considerations of cylindrical and spherical pores in this model predicted almost the same swelling behaviour. Expressions relating mass and volume with time have been formulated and they agreed well with experimental observations. The dependence of characteristic time ($\tau$) upon structural parameters have been established. Values of swelling related parameters have been determined by a numerical fitting of theoretical model to experimental data. The agreement of experimental findings with theoretical predictions has been depicted graphically.},

abstract = {Most animals exhibit significant neurological and morphological change throughout their lifetime. No robots to date, however, grow new morphological structure while behaving. This is due to technological limitations but also because it is unclear that morphological change provides a benefit to the acquisition of robust behavior in machines. Here I show that in evolving populations of simulated robots, if robots grow from anguilliform into legged robots during their lifetime in the early stages of evolution, and the anguilliform body plan is gradually lost during later stages of evolution, gaits are evolved for the final, legged form of the robot more rapidly--and the evolved gaits are more robust--compared to evolving populations of legged robots that do not transition through the anguilliform body plan. This suggests that morphological change, as well as the evolution of development, are two important processes that improve the automatic generation of robust behaviors for machines. It also provides an experimental platform for investigating the relationship between the evolution of development and robust behavior in biological organisms.},

In this paper, failure maps of sandwich beams with composite skin and honeycomb core are obtained. The effect of transverse shear in skins and core and the effect of double walls of honeycomb core have been taken into account. Shear deformation of skins and core are assumed to be linear. By minimizing the potential energy equation, the shear deformation coefficients of core and skins are obtained. Axial stresses in skins and core are obtained in terms of these coefficients. Core is assumed to have orthotropic properties. Three point bending tests have been performed on some sandwich beam specimens. It is found that specimens for which failure load and its corresponding failure mode lie away from the boundary lines in failure map, there is a little difference between failure loads obtained from theories and experiments but this difference is more significant near the boundary lines due to combination of failure modes. In the case of transverse ribbon direction, the theoretical and experimental results are closer. KEYWORDS Sandwich beam, failure maps, honeycomb, composite skins and transverse shear stress.},

abstract = {Shape change is a prevalent function apparent in a diverse set of natural structures, including seed dispersal units, climbing plants and carnivorous plants. Many of these natural materials change shape by using cellulose microfibrils at specific orientations to anisotropically restrict the swelling/shrinkage of their organic matrices upon external stimuli. This is in contrast to the material-specific mechanisms found in synthetic shape-memory systems. Here we propose a robust and universal method to replicate this unusual shape-changing mechanism of natural systems in artificial bioinspired composites. The technique is based upon the remote control of the orientation of reinforcing inorganic particles within the composite using a weak external magnetic field. Combining this reinforcement orientational control with swellable/shrinkable polymer matrices enables the creation of composites whose shape change can be programmed into the material's microstructure rather than externally imposed. Such bioinspired approach can generate composites with unusual reversibility, twisting effects and site-specific programmable shape changes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 SPIE. Multifunctional Dielectric Elastomer (DE) devices are well established as actuators, sensors and energy har-vesters. Since the invention of the Dielectric Elastomer Switch (DES), a piezoresistive electrode that can directly switch charge on and off, it has become possible to expand the wide functionality of DE structures even more. We show the application of fully soft DE subcomponents in biomimetic robotic structures. It is now possible to couple arrays of actuator/switch units together so that they switch charge between them-selves on and off. One can then build DE devices that operate as self-controlled oscillators. With an oscillator one can produce a periodic signal that controls a soft DE robot- A DE device with its own DE nervous system. DESs were fabricated using a special electrode mixture, and imprinting technology at an exact pre-strain. We have demonstrated six orders of magnitude change in conductivity within the DES over 50{\%} strain. The control signal can either be a mechanical deformation from another DE or an electrical input to a connected dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA). We have demonstrated a variety of fully soft multifunctional subcomponents that enable the design of autonomous soft robots without conventional electronics. The combination of digital logic structures for basic signal processing, data storage in dielectric elastomer flip-flops and digital and analogue clocks with adjustable frequencies, made of dielectric elastomer oscillators (DEOs), enables fully soft, self-controlled and electronics-free robotic structures. DE robotic structures to date include stiff frames to maintain necessary pre-strains enabling sufficient actuation of DEAs. Here we present a design and production technology for a first robotic structure consisting only of soft silicones and carbon black.},

In the past, using printed active composites to create origami structures was demonstrated but was limited to simple folding patterns. In this paper, we study the relationship among folding angle, fiber orientation, and applied load during programming, in order to find the optimized fiber arrangement and loading directions for complicated folding patterns. Both experiments and finite element1 simulations were performed to optimize the fiber orientations in PAC in order to achieve the desired shape change, and good agreement was achieved. FEA was then used to help the design for some complicated, self-folding, active origami structures-including a miura-ori pattern, a table, a sailboat and a crane—in which the folding occurs in different directions. The successful implementation of these complicated patterns demonstrates the capability of using printed active composites for very complicated self-folding origami designs. {\textcopyright}2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

abstract = {Emerging soft robots with infinite degrees of freedom are one step closer to providing better human-machine interactions than conventional hard and stiff robots, attributing to their outstanding compliance/adaptability, evenly distributed stress, and programmable actuating behaviors. Soft matter (e.g., hydrogels and elastomers) with high mechanical stability has been usually adopted for the fabrication of soft robots. However, soft matter exhibits limited optical, electrical, thermal, and chemical properties that restrict the development of functional soft robots. An emerging approach is to develop multifunctional robotic materials that are reconfigurable and can provide diverse built-in functions, such as wide-spectrum protection, tactile sensing, remote control, and wireless communication. To realize this approach, two-dimensional (2D) materials with diverse yet unique physicochemical properties have been recently integrated with soft matter to bring in add-on functionalities for fabricated soft robots. In this Minireview, we highlight three integration approaches for the fabrication of 2D material-soft matter robotic materials: (i) heterogenous blending of 2D materials within soft matter precursors followed by in situ crosslinking/curing; (ii) bilayer integration of 2D materials with soft matter substrates; and (iii) post-stabilization of 2D material (or 2D materiallated) architectures with elastomers. The advantages and drawbacks of each approach regarding the fabrication process and resulting characteristics are discussed in detail. The reversible actuating behaviors and built-in capabilities of the as-fabricated 2D material-soft matter composites, as well as their further applications as multifunctional robotic materials are summarized. Finally, current research gaps and future directions regarding the development of multifunctional robotic materials are addressed from our perspective by considering the design principles for future untethered soft robots.},

abstract = {Control of robots with soft actuators is still challenging due to the complexity of modeling actuator material dynamics in conjunction with the robot dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a 45-mm-long soft continuum robot with distributed local actuators in the form of cubes composed of a novel temperature-responsive hydrogel, each with an embedded Joule heater. We refer to these as soft voxel actuators (SVAs). We present a dynamical model of this hydrogel-based continuum robot based on Cosserat rod theory. We experimentally identify the relationship between step input voltages applied to the SVAs and their resulting force outputs. In addition, we identify other unknown parameters of the model using vibration tests with the robot. We then numerically solve the Cosserat model and compare simulations of the model to measurements of the robot's tip displacement over time during open-loop control trials in which subsets of the SVAs are actuated. The normalized root-mean-square errors (NRMSEs) between the simulated and experimentally measured displacements are below 10{\%}, which demonstrates the accuracy of the Cosserat model in describing the dynamics of the hydrogel-based continuum robot.},

abstract = {The move toward sustainability and efficiency in nearly every field calls for dynamic materials that can harvest energy from and adapt to a changing environment. Here we review our recently developed, widely applicable strategy for adaptive surface design that integrates two rarely associated categories of materials-nanostructured surfaces and hydrogels-into a hybrid architecture. The nanostructure arrays provide unique topographic patterns that confer wetting, optical, and many other functions but on their own are generally static; by embedding them in a layer of responsive hydrogel, we channel the mechanical forces generated within the swelling/contracting gel to reversibly reconfigure the nanostructures in response to stimuli. Since the sensing and responding components are structurally distinct, they can each be programmed independently to match potentially almost any type of environmental change with almost any type of output. Several of our recent advances in nanofabrication make it possible to choose from an entire spectrum of nanostructured materials, stiffnesses, shapes, symmetries, orientations, and large-scale surface gradients, enabling a given stimulus to be translated into a vast assortment of complex multiscale patterns and adaptive responses. The gel chemistry and nanostructure flexibility can be further optimized for incorporating the surfaces into a variety of structures and environments. We envision using this platform to create a generation of sustainable, self-adapting, and self-reporting materials. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Towards this goal, photolatently reactive hydrogels are very promising. Here we develop photolatently modulable hydrogels, composed of a polymer network accommodating photocatalytic titania nanosheets at every crosslinking point. As titania nanosheets can utilize gelling water as their source of radicals, its long-lasting photocatalysis makes the hydrogels readily modulable. Benefiting from the hydrogelation mechanism, the gel network is finely compartmentalized, leading to sharp thermoresponses. As demonstrated by photo-micropatterning, non-diffusible titania nanosheets at the crosslinking points enable pointwise modulations with an excellent spatial resolution. The photolatent nature also makes it possible to conjugate them with other hydrogels and polymers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sequential deformations of patterned hydrogels into 3D configurations with multilevel structures are reported, which are realized for the first time in self-shaping materials. The periodically patterned single-layer hydrogels with different polymers are fabricated by multi-step photolithography. After swelling in water, the expansion of compartmentalized high-swelling gels is constrained by the dispersed non-swelling gels, resulting in out-of-plane buckling with high cooperativity and thus forming alternating concave–convex configuration. When the dispersed non-swelling gels are partly replaced by thermoresponsive ones, the preformed overall flat, yet locally undulant, hydrogel deforms further into dome-, saddle-, or sandglass-like configurations at elevated temperature. As such, multilevel 3D structures can be achieved via prebuilt mechanical/geometric cues in a sequentially controlled manner. This conceptual design and sequential deformation of patterned hydrogels to form 3D configurations with multilevel structures should enrich the deformation/functioning modes of morphing materials and broaden their applications in diverse areas.},

The basic idea is to tuck fold a planar paper to form a three-dimensional shape. The main contribution is to solve the inverse problem; the input is an arbitrary polyhedral surface and the output is the folding pattern. Our approach is to convert this problem into a problem of laying out the polygons of the surface on a planar paper by introducing the concept of tucking molecules. We investigate the equality and inequality conditions required for constructing a valid crease pattern. We propose an algorithm based on two-step mapping and edge splitting to solve these conditions. The two-step mapping precalculates linear equalities and separates them from other conditions. This allows an interactive manipulation of the crease pattern in the system implementation. We present the first system for designing three-dimensional origami, enabling a user can interactively design complex spatial origami models that have not been realizable thus far.},

A three-dimensional numerical method is also employed to predict the total velocity field through simulation. Comparison of the experimental and numerical velocity and vorticity fields shows good agreement. The fish morphology, with its narrow peduncle region, allows for smooth flow into the articulated tail, which is able to sustain a large load for thrust generation. Streamlines of the flow detail complex processes that enhance the efficiency of flow actuation by the tail. The fish benefits from smooth near-body flow patterns and the generation of controlled body-bound vorticity, which is propagated towards the tail, shed prior to the peduncle region and then manipulated by the caudal fin to form large-scale vortical structures with minimum wasted energy. This manipulation of body-generated vorticity and its interaction with the vorticity generated by the oscillating caudal fin are fundamental to the propulsion and maneuvering capabilities of fish.},

In this work, flexible thermoplastic polyurethane/multiwalled carbon nanotube (TPU-MWCNT) composites were printed using multi-material fused filament fabrication (FFF) to study their feasibility towards built-in sensing capabilities in soft robotics. The microstructure, electrical conductivity, capacitive sensing, and piezoresistive sensing of the printed samples were investigated. MWCNT content, print orientation, and layer height was found to be the most influential parameters on the electrical properties while the nozzle and bed temperatures showed insignificant impacts. Overall, the in-line and through-line conductivities were one order of magnitude higher than the through-layer conductivity. Once the printing process was optimized, nanocomposites with 3 and 4 wt.{\%}MWCNT showed repeatable and frequency independent conductivity behavior, reaching to a maximum value of 0.10 and 0.32 S/cm, respectively. A soft pneumatic actuator was then designed and printed out of TPU-MWCNT using the optimized process conditions. The built-in capacitive and piezoresistive sensing capabilities of the printed actuators were successfully demonstrated upon gripping contact and actuation at three different pressure levels. This work unveils the potential of integrating a variety of feedback sensors in robotic actuators through FFF process.},

Swelling studies showed an increase in equilibrium water content and hydrogel porosity as the NaCl concentration in the polymerization medium increased from 0 to 0.7 M. The equilibrium water content, however, decreased as the NaCl concentration in the swelling medium increased. The frozen water content increased and non-frozen water decreased with an increase in the NaCl concentration in the polymerization medium. Mechanical testing indicated that the elastic modulus of the hydrogels was not affected by the increased porosity until the pores became interconnected. These data suggest that the addition of NaCl to the polymerization medium results in a multi-phase separation during fabrication that produces macroporous hydrogels of controlled morphology.},

abstract = {•The paper reviews a recent development in soft robotics.•Soft materials in animals inspire a new wave of robotics.•Current enabling technologies in soft robotics and challenges are discussed.•Potential convergence between soft robotics and tissue engineering is introduced. Animals exploit soft structures to move effectively in complex natural environments. These capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. The goal is to endow robots with new, bioinspired capabilities that permit adaptive, flexible interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review emerging soft-bodied robotic systems, and in particular recent developments inspired by soft-bodied animals. Incorporating soft technologies can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity involved in robot design. Incorporating soft technologies will also expedite the evolution of robots that can safely interact with humans and natural environments. Finally, soft robotics technology can be combined with tissue engineering to create hybrid systems for medical applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Of special interest in the growing field of origami engineering is self-folding, wherein a material is able to fold itself in response to an applied field. In order to simulate the effect of active materials on an origami-inspired design, a dynamic model is needed. Ideally, the model would be an aid in determining how much active material is needed and where it should be placed to actuate the model to the desired position(s). A dynamic model of the origami waterbomb base, a well-known and foundational origami mechanism, is developed using adams 2014, a commercial multibody dynamics software package. Creases are approximated as torsion springs with both stiffness and damping. The stiffness of an origami crease is calculated, and the dynamic model is verified using the waterbomb. An approximation of the torque produced by magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) is calculated and is used to simulate MAE-actuated self-folding of the waterbomb. Experimental validation of the self-folding waterbomb model is performed, verifying that the dynamic model is capable of accurate simulation of the fold angles.},

abstract = {The capability of cellulose microfibrils to elicit directionality by anisotropically restricting the deformation of amorphous biogenic matrices is central to the motility of many plants as motoric and shape-restoring elements. Herein, an approach is described to control directionality of artificial composite actuators that mimic the hygroinduced motion of composite plant tissues such as the opening of seed pods, winding of plant tendrils, and burial of seed awns. The actuators are designed as bilayer structures where single or double networks of buried parallel glass fibers reinforce the composite. By anisotropically restricting the expansion along certain directions they also effectively direct the mechanical reconfiguration, thereby determining the mechanical effect. A mathematical model is developed to quantify the kinematic response of fiber-reinforced actuators. Within a broader context, the results of this study provide means for control over mechanical deformation of artificial dynamic elements that mimic the oriented fibrous architectures in biogenic motoric elements.},

Over the past few decades, there has been considerable progress in developing new actuation technologies. However, controlled motion still represents a considerable bottleneck for many applications and hampers the development of advanced robots, especially at small length scales. Nature has solved this problem using molecular motors that, through living cells, are assembled into multiscale ensembles with integrated control systems. These systems can scale force production from piconewtons up to kilonewtons. By leveraging the performance of living cells and tissues and directly interfacing them with artificial components, it should be possible to exploit the intricacy and metabolic efficiency of biological actuation within artificial machines. We provide a survey of important advances in this biohybrid actuation paradigm.},

abstract = {Bilayer bending based soft actuators are widely utilized in soft robotics for locomotion and object gripping. However, studies on soft actuators based on bilayer doming remain largely unexplored despite the often-observed dome-like shapes in undersea animals such as jellyfish and octopus suction cup. Here, based on the simplified model of bending-induced doming of circular bilayer plates with mismatched deformation, we explore the design of soft doming actuator upon pneumatic actuation and its implications in design of multifunctional soft machines. The bilayer actuator is composed of patterned embedded pneumatic channel on top for radial expansion and a solid elastomeric layer on bottom for strain-limiting. We show that both the cavity volume and bending angle at the rim of the actuated dome can be controlled by tuning the height gradient of the pneumatic channel along the radial direction. We demonstrate its potential multifunctional applications in swimming, adhesion, and gripping, including high efficient jellyfish-inspired underwater soft robots with locomotion speed of 84 cm/min and rotation-based soft grippers with low energy cost by harnessing the large rim bending angle, as well as octopus-inspired soft adhesion actuators with strong and switchable adhesion force of over 10 N by utilizing the large cavity volume.},

abstract = {—The compliance of soft grippers contributes to their great superiority over rigid grippers in grasping irregularly shaped objects and forming soft contact with environments. Due to a rel-atively small pressure, soft grippers lack the stiffness required for wider applications. Particle jamming has been frequently re-ported as a means of stiffness control. Unlike previous research using vacuum for particle jamming, this paper proposes a novel passive particle jamming principle that does not need any vac-uum power or other control means. The proposed method is by simply patching a silicone rubber soft actuator and a pack (made of strain-limiting membrane) of particles to form an integral grip-ping finger. The inflation of the soft actuator applies a pressure to the particle pack causing particles inside it to jam. A larger squeez-ing pressure will result in tighter particle jamming, thus increasing the stiffness of the finger. The stiffness of the finger is controllable as it is proportional to the actuator's air pressure, which has been verified by experiments in this research. The stiffness can increase more than six fold when air pressure changes from 20 to 80 kPa in the experimental studies. The reported discovery may enhance the capabilities of soft robotic grippers so that more robotic picking operations could be performed by soft grippers.},

The proposed manipulator is based on a series of identical modules, each one consisting of a silicone tube with pneumatic chambers for allowing 3D motion and one central channel for the implementation of the granular jamming phenomenon for stiffening. The silicone is covered by a novel bellows-shaped braided structure maximizing the bending still limiting lateral expansion.

abstract = {To navigate different environments, an animal must be able to adapt its locomotory gait to its physical surroundings. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, between swimming in water and crawling on surfaces, adapts its locomotory gait to surroundings that impose approximately 10,000-fold differences in mechanical resistance. Here we investigate this feat by studying the undulatory movements of C. elegans in Newtonian fluids spanning nearly five orders of magnitude in viscosity. In these fluids, the worm undulatory gait varies continuously with changes in external load: As load increases, both wavelength and frequency of undulation decrease. We also quantify the internal viscoelastic properties of the worm's body and their role in locomotory dynamics. We incorporate muscle activity, internal load, and external load into a biomechanical model of locomotion and show that (i) muscle power is nearly constant across changes in locomotory gait, and (ii) the onset of gait adaptation occurs as external load becomes comparable to internal load. During the swimming gait, which is evoked by small external loads, muscle power is primarily devoted to bending the worm's elastic body. During the crawling gait, evoked by large external loads, comparable muscle power is used to drive the external load and the elastic body. Our results suggest that C. elegans locomotory gait continuously adapts to external mechanical load in order to maintain propulsive thrust.},

We describe the construction of a prototype manipulator structure with six compliant legs connected in a parallel pattern similar to that of a Stewart-Gough platform. We formulate the static forward and inverse kinematics problems for such manipulators as the solution to multiple Cosserat-rod models with coupled boundary conditions, and we test the accuracy of this approach in a set of experiments, including the prediction of leg buckling. An inverse kinematics simulation of slices through the 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) workspace illustrates the kinematic mapping, range of motion, and force required for actuation, which sheds light on the potential advantages and tradeoffs that parallel continuum manipulators may bring.

abstract = {This article describes a hybrid robotic system combining hard and soft subsystems. This hybrid comprises a wheeled robot (an iRobot Create; hard) and a four-legged quadruped (soft). It is capable (using a simple, wireless control system) of rapid locomotion over flat terrain (using the wheeled hard robot) and of gripping and retrieving an object (using the independent locomotive capabilities of the soft robot). The utility of this system is demonstrated by performing a mission requiring the capabilities of both components: retrieving an object (iPod Nano) from the center of a room. This class of robot—hybrids comprising hard and soft systems functioning synergistically—is capable of performing tasks that neither can do alone. In contrast to specialized hard robotic arms with grippers (capable of performing some of the functions we describe here), which are complex, rela-tively expensive, and require sophisticated controls, this hybrid system is easy to construct, simple to control, and low in cost. The soft robotic system in the hybrid is lightweight, disposable if contaminated or damaged, and capable of multiple functions.},

abstract = {Significant efforts have been made to develop highly tough hydrogels towards many scientific and industrial applications. However, most of the as-prepared tough hydrogels lose their mechanical strength and toughness when they swell in aqueous solution. Current knowledge about the swelling-induced mechanical property changes mainly stems from single-network (SN) hydrogels and chemically linked double-network (DN) hydrogels, but little is known about the swelling mechanical properties of hybrid physically-chemically linked DN gels. Here, we synthesized hybrid agar/PAM DN hydrogels combining a physically cross-linked first network of agar and a covalently cross-linked second network of polyacrylamide (PAM), with particular attention paid to the relationship between the swelling and mechanical properties of the hydrogels. The optimal agar/PAM DN gels achieved a tensile stress of [similar]1.0 MPa and a toughness of [similar]3988 J m-2 in the as-prepared state and a tensile stress of 1.4 MPa and a toughness of [similar]3960 J m-2 in the swollen state. The agar/PAM DN gels can readily achieve swelling ratios in the range of [similar]1.3-3.6 by adjusting the concentrations of the first network, the second network, and the crosslinker. The swelling capacity of the agar/PAM DN gels was balanced by the competition between the "non-swellable" agar network and the "highly swellable" PAM network, indicating that the first and second networks play different roles in the swelling-induced mechanical properties of the agar/PAM gels. Based on a comparison of the tearing and tensile behaviors of the hybrid DN gels between both as-prepared and swollen gels, we proposed a swelling-induced fracture mechanism that is different from those of SN and chemically-linked DN hydrogels. This work not only demonstrates a very tough swollen DN gel with a hybrid network, but also provides a better understanding of the swelling characteristics of hybrid DN gels, which hopefully helps to offer some valuable insights into the development of next-generation tough hydrogel materials in both as-prepared and swollen states.},

abstract = {Provision of modified foods and drinks is one of the approaches for dysphagia management, which is based on the assumption that food with proper texture and rheological properties will allow dysphagia patients to swallow safely and maintain adequate nutrition. However, lack of information about the in vivo swallowing process and its interaction with food flow has obstructed the effective management of dysphagia. In the esophageal swallowing stage, masticated food is transported through the esophagus to the stomach by a peristaltic mechanism, which is generated by sequential contraction and relaxation of esophageal muscles. Inspired by this behavior, a soft actuator is proposed to provide a nonrisk environment aiming to facilitate investigations of the most effective properties of food for the management of the swallowing disorders. The wave-like motion is first specified according to the in vivo measurement of human esophageal peristalsis. Finite-element analysis simulations are carried out to aid the structure design before prototype manufacture. Constructed by casting silicon rubber in a three-dimensional (3-D) printed customized mold, the novel actuator has soft structure resembling its human counterpart, which has a flexible muscular structure. Multiple layers of inflatable chambers are embedded and distributed along the axis of a food passage regularly, which locates at the center of the actuator. The actuator is capable of generating a peristaltic wave and pushing a bolus along the passage. The closure of the tube and the velocity of the propagation wave are going to be adjusted to achieve the trajectories recorded experimentally, by regulating the compressed air pressure pumped into chambers actively. {\textcopyright} 1996-2012 IEEE.},

Consequently self-contained Pedestrian Dead-Reckoning (PDR) approaches are gaining interest for autonomous navigation. Even if the quality of low cost inertial sensors and magnetometers has strongly improved, processing noisy sensor signals combined with high hand dynamics remains a challenge. Estimating accurate attitude angles for achieving long term positioning accuracy is targeted in this work. A new Magnetic, Acceleration fields and GYroscope Quaternion (MAGYQ)-based attitude angles estimation filter is proposed and demonstrated with handheld sensors. It benefits from a gyroscope signal modelling in the quaternion set and two new opportunistic updates: magnetic angular rate update (MARU) and acceleration gradient update (AGU). MAGYQ filter performances are assessed indoors, outdoors, with dynamic and static motion conditions. The heading error, using only the inertial solution, is found to be less than 10° after 1.5 km walking. The performance is also evaluated in the positioning domain with trajectories computed following a PDR strategy.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, evidence accumulated by several groups of independent investigators suggested that there were at least two species of octopuses referred to in literature accounts as Octopus joubini Robson, 1929. Since Robson's (1929) original description of the gravid, female holotype collected at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, virtually the entire body of literature on the systematics, biology and life history of O. joubini has incorporated specimens collected from two shallow water Florida localities: Biscayne Bay and St. Joseph Bay. Both populations produce large eggs (6-8 mm long) and benthic hatchlings. The second pygmy species produces small eggs (2-5 mm long) and planktonic hatchlings. Based on examination of ovarian eggs from the holotype of O. joubini Robson, 1929, it has been detennined that the small egg form, not the large egg foim of the western Atlantic Ocean pygmy octopus, supports the name O. joubini. Octopus mercatoris Adam, 1937, is also referable to this complex but it is not now known whether it is conspecific with the large or small egg pygmy octopus or represents a third species in this complex. If not conspecific with O. mercatoris, the common, large egg species is undescribed. The first observations on the life history and biology of the "true" Octopus joubini were obtained from live animals collected south of Galveston, Texas and cultured in the laboratory. The species produces small eggs (2.3-4.8 mm long) that are attached individually to surrounding substrate. Maximum fecundity is 2,400 eggs and development requires approximately 35 days at 25°C. In all broods observed, the female deposits eggs over a minimum of 4 weeks resulting in all or most developmental stages being present by the time the first laid eggs complete their development. The planktonic hatchlings are 2.0-2.5 mm mantle length and have approximately 420 chromatophores. Two hatchlings were cultured through the planktonic stage to settlement in 21 days. Life span is temperature dependent and estimated to range from 6-12 months.},

These bioinspired artificial swimmers are capable of color changing in response to a variety of environmental stimuli such as temperature, pH, and light. By multiplexing different stimuli-responsive materials on a single swimmer, a vast library of independently addressable colors can be achieved. Unlike other color-changing robots, our color-changing swimmers can move autonomously in solution and are decoupled from tethered supports. The utilized leuco dyes, pH indicators, and phosphorescent powders display excellent reversibility and prolonged color retention. Finally, we design camouflage patterns which render the swimmers invisible against virtually any background, while revealing the swimmer upon changing the environmental conditions. By mimicking animal camouflage strategies these artificial swimmers present a significant step toward realizing multienvironmental stimuli-responsive color-changing strategies for the next generation of smart robotics. Such capabilities can be further enhanced by coupling color-changing ability with stimuli-triggered speed or shape change.},

abstract = {Morphing, understood as the ability to undergo pronounced shape adaptations to optimally respond to a diversity of operational conditions, has been singled out as a future direction in the pursuit of maximised efficiency of lightweight structures. Whereas a certain degree of adaptivity can be accomplished conventionally by means of mechanical systems, compliance allowing for substantial reversible deformability exhibits far more potential as a morphing strategy. A promising solution to the inherent contradiction between high stiffness and reversible deformation capacity posed by morphing is offered by introducing variable stiffness components. This notion indicates the provision of a controllable range of deformation resistance levels in place of fixed properties, as required by real-time shape adaptation dictated by maximum efficiency under changing external conditions. With special emphasis on the morphing context, the current review aims to identify the main tendencies, undertaking a systematic classification of existing approaches involving stiffness variability. Four broad categories in which variable stiffness has been applied to morphing are therefore distinguished and detailed: material engineering, active mechanical design, semi-active techniques and elastic structural behaviour. Adopting a wide perspective, the study highlights key capabilities, limitations and challenges. The need for attention directed to the variable stiffness strategy is recognised and the significance of intensive research activities in a highly integrated and multidisciplinary environment emphasised if higher maturity stages of the concepts are to be reached. Finally, the potential of emerging directions of semi-active design involving electro-bonded laminates and multi-stable structures is brought into focus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cheney2014,
abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with di↵erent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at di↵erent levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversityencouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

To understand current technologies, we carried out a keyword search using the Web of Science and Scopus databases, applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and compared several characteristics of the soft robotic devices for MIS in the resulting articles. There was low diversity in the device designs and a wide-ranging level of detail regarding their capabilities.

abstract = {• Ieee rObOtICS {\&} AUtOmAtION mAGAZINe • t he need for building ro ­ bots with soft materials emerged recently from considerations of the li ­ mitations of service robots in negotiating natural environments, from observation of the role of comp­ liance in animals and plants [1], and even from the role attributed to the physical body in movement control and intelligence, in the so­called embodied intelligence or morphological computation paradigm [2]–[4]. The wide spread of soft robotics relies on numerous investigations of diverse materials and technologies for actuation and sensing, and on research of control tech ­ niques, all of which can serve the purpose of building robots with high deformability and compliance. But the core challenge of soft robotics research is, in fact, the variability and controllability of such deformability and compliance. In nature, there are some examples of soft structures with variable stiffness: the octopus is able to selectively stiffen parts of its arms to use them as a modifiable skele­ ton, and the squid with its tentacles and the elephant with its trunk can do the same to transmit very high forces. Tongues in general and human lips are other examples. Stiffness tuning is the way soft structures (natural or artifi­ cial) can effectively interact with the environment. Inher­ ent softness enables dexterity and safe interactions (preventing damage to the environment and to the entity), but stiffening is required to increase the forces transferred to the environment when necessary. Thus, this has to be done on demand and possibly without deformation. This article reviews the approaches for on­demand stiffening obtained through direct activation of soft actu­ ation technologies, which are being explored for soft robotics. We exclude from this review the stiffness change},

In this mini-review, untethered soft grippers are discussed, with an emphasis on a class of autonomous stimuli responsive gripping soft tools that can be used to excise tissues and release drugs in a controlled manner. The grippers are composed of polymers and hydrogels, and are thus compliant to soft tissues. They can be navigated using magnetic fields and controlled by robotic path-planning strategies to carry out tasks like pick-and-place of microspheres and biological materials either with user assistance or in a fully autonomous manner. It is envisioned that the use of these untethered soft grippers will translate from laboratory experiments to clinical scenarios and the challenges that need to be overcome to make this transition are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a data-driven motion control approach for a biomimetic robotic fish. The task of the motion control is to achieve desired motion by means of controlling the fish-like swimming gaits of the robot. Due to the complexity of hydrodynamics, it is impossible to derive an analytic model that can precisely describe the interaction between the robotic fish and surrounding water during motion. To address the lack of the robotic model, we explore data-based modeling and control design methods. First, through biomimetic learning from real fish motion data, a General Internal Model (GIM) is established. GIM translates fish undulatory body motion into robotic joint movement; associates the fish gait patterns, such as cruise and turning, with corresponding joint coordination; and adjusts the robotic velocity by GIM parameters. Second, by collecting robotic motion data at a set of operating points, we obtain the quantitative mapping from GIM tuning parameters to robotic speed. Third, applying the quantitative mapping and using GIM parameters as manipulating variables, a feedforward control is computed according to the desired speed, which greatly expedites the initial movement of the robotic fish. Fourth, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) is employed as feedback control, together with an inverse mapping that compensates for the nonlinearity appeared in the quantitative mapping. Fifth, modified Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) is developed as an appropriate data-driven tuning approach to determine controller gains. By switching between feedforward and feedback, the motion performance is improved. Finally, real-time control of robotic fish is implemented on a two-joint platform, and two representative swimming gaits, namely "cruise" and "cruise in turning", are achieved.},

The natural analogues of such systems are exemplified by nastic plant motions, where a variety of organs such as tendrils, bracts, leaves and flowers respond to environmental stimuli (such as humidity, light or touch) by varying internal turgor, which leads to dynamic conformations governed by the tissue composition and microstructural anisotropy of cell walls. Inspired by these botanical systems, we printed composite hydrogel architectures that are encoded with localized, anisotropic swelling behaviour controlled by the alignment of cellulose fibrils along prescribed four-dimensional printing pathways. When combined with a minimal theoretical framework that allows us to solve the inverse problem of designing the alignment patterns for prescribed target shapes, we can programmably fabricate plant-inspired architectures that change shape on immersion in water, yielding complex three-dimensional morphologies.},

This is achieved by maximizing the mechanical flexural strength and electrical dielectric strength through the use of laser-induced melting or polishing, insulating edge coating, and crack-arresting features, combined with features for rigid ground attachments to maximize force output. Manufacturing techniques have also been developed to enable mass customization, in which sheets of material are pre-stacked to form a laminate from which nearly arbitrary planar actuator designs can be fabricated using only laser cutting. These techniques have led to a 70{\%} increase in energy density and an increase in mean lifetime of at least 15× compared to prior manufacturing methods. In addition, measurements have revealed a doubling of the piezoelectric coefficient when operating at the high fields necessary to achieve maximal energy densities, along with an increase in the Young's modulus at the high compressive strains encountered - these two effects help to explain the higher performance of our actuators as compared to that predicted by linear models. {\textcopyright}2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In fact, musculature has been deemed the “prototypical soft actuator” because it can achieve fast, strong actuation and remarkably complex patterns of movement. [1] Replication of these motions with traditional robotic systems is challenging, and involves complex mechanisms and many actuators. Furthermore, while the impedance of a robotic system can be modulated using force feedback and advanced control methods, it is diffi cult to achieve values similar to biological tissue. The emerging fi eld of “soft robotics” lends itself to replicating biomimetic motions, having simple and low cost actuation and the capability to achieve bending, twisting, extension and fl exion with non-rigid materials. However, complex motion often requires specifi cally designed actuators with multiple internal channels or complex cavities for actuation.

abstract = {Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90{\%} of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg-all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.},

In addition, by locking and unlocking joints, the hand can adopt configurations and grasp sequences that would otherwise require a fully actuated solution. Other features of the hand include an integrated sensing suite that uses a common transduction technology on flexible printed circuits for tactile and proprioceptive sensing. The hand is analyzed using a three-dimensional rigid body analysis package with efficient simulation of compliant mechanisms and contacts with friction. This package allows one to evaluate design tradeoffs among link lengths, required tendon tensions, spring stiffnesses and braking requirements to grasp and hold a wide range of objects. Results of grasping and pullout tests confirm the utility of the simulations.},

abstract = {Soft robots are machines, and like all machines their function is to convert energy from one form into another to perform tasks. One key figure of merit for machines is their efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of task-oriented work out to total energy in. All soft robots convert stored energy (from e.g., batteries, pressurized gas, chemicals) into task-oriented work (picking up objects, locomoting, jumping). These systems are complex hybrids of chemical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electrical components. This complexity makes it difficult to analyze and measure their total efficiency and to identify the sources of energy loss between chemical, electrical, and mechanical domains. As the field of soft robotics matures, the design-flow process will shift from one in which building is central to one in which simulation takes precedence. That is, there is a shift from an empirical experimental methodology toward a well-characterized engineering workflow. At this point, questions such as ''For how long will this robot run on a 2000 mAh battery?'' will need to be answered, and predictive capabilities will become paramount as designers need to understand: (1) the large-scale deformations inherent to soft robotic systems; and (2) the transduction of energy in these complex, dissipative, systems to enable them to design an efficient and a well-controlled system. In this perspective piece, we discuss one possible predictive approach: a framework that uses port-based modeling. This approach uses bond-graphs and the recently developed port-Hamiltonian theory to provide a step-by-step system for analyzing hybrid, multi-domain, soft robotic systems. We discuss how this framework could be applied to controlling and optimizing soft robotic systems for energy efficiency, thereby increasing their utility. An energy-based approach is useful as a domain-free linker in analyzing complex systems; the use of ports promotes a clear distinction between energy conservation and dissipation and facilitates the analysis of efficiency. In addition, the parallels with hardware description languages and object-oriented programming will make it easier for engineers to design, for soft robots, control systems that optimize for efficiency.},

abstract = {Abstract We describe an approach for the discrete and reversible assembly of tunable and actively deformable structures using modular building block parts for robotic applications. The primary technical challenge addressed by this work is the use of this method to design and fabricate low density, highly compliant robotic structures with spatially tuned stiffness. This approach offers a number of potential advantages over more conventional methods for constructing compliant robots. The discrete assembly reduces manufacturing complexity, as relatively simple parts can be batch-produced and joined to make complex structures. Global mechanical properties can be tuned based on sub-part ordering and geometry, because local stiffness and density can be independently set to a wide range of values and varied spatially. The structure's intrinsic modularity can significantly simplify analysis and simulation. Simple analytical models for the behavior of each building block type can be calibrated with empirical testi...},

abstract = {This paper reports the rationale and design of a robotic arm, as inspired by an octopus arm. The octopus arm shows peculiar features, such as the ability to bend in all directions, to produce fast elongations, and to vary its stiffness. The octopus achieves these unique motor skills, thanks to its peculiar muscular structure, named muscular hydrostat. Different muscles arranged on orthogonal planes generate an antagonistic action on each other in the muscular hydrostat, which does not change its volume during muscle contractions, and allow bending and elongation of the arm and stiffness variation. By drawing inspiration from natural skills of octopus, and by analysing the geometry and mechanics of the muscular structure of its arm, we propose the design of a robot arm consisting of an artificial muscular hydrostat structure, which is completely soft and compliant, but also able to stiffen. In this paper, we discuss the design criteria of the robotic arm and how this design and the special arrangement of its muscular structure may bring the building of a robotic arm into being, by showing the results obtained by mathematical models and prototypical mock-ups.},

Masked deposition eliminates the need for manual injection fi lling, which enables certain geometries that cannot be produced by injection and allows for the automated, high-volume production of Ga-In based “liquid-embedded elastomer electronics” (LE3).

Robots created under this paradigm offer many advantages and represent unique features in terms of flexibility, dexterity, safety, and weight reduction. This paper introduces a novel continuum manipulator that integrates multiple layers of compliant planar springs - a structure that provides several notable advantages over existing designs. First, it possesses precise linear large-displacement motion. In this context, we utilize the linear output motion of each layer of springs. With the serial connection of multiple conjoined layers, the manipulator demonstrates linear predictable bending even when executing large bends. An analytical method is provided to study the compliance characteristics of the planar spring and derive the compliance matrix to represent the force-deflection relationships, allowing an accurate motion prediction. Second, compared with work elsewhere, this structure demonstrates an effective way of decoupling bending from contraction and expansion. It reduces the uncontrolled compression when generating normal deflections, thus controlling robot bending is simplified. Third, the reachable workspace of the end effector is enlarged by means of varying the length of the continuum manipulator via controlled contraction and expansion. A 3-D printed prototype of this continuum manipulator is experimentally evaluated. The conducted experiments demonstrated validity of our approach.},

The article shows that highly stretchable strain sensors are successfully being developed by new mechanisms such as disconnection between overlapped nanomaterials, crack propagation in thin films, and tunneling effect, different from traditional strain sensing mechanisms. Strain sensing performances of recently reported strain sensors are comprehensively studied and discussed, showing that appropriate choice of composite structures as well as suitable interaction between functional nanomaterials and polymers are essential for the high performance strain sensing. Next, simulation results of piezoresistivity of stretchable strain sensors by computational models are reported. Finally, potential applications of flexible strain sensors are described. This survey reveals that flexible, skin-mountable, and wearable strain sensors have potential in diverse applications while several grand challenges have to be still overcome. Stretchable and sensitive strain sensors can potentially function for biomedical applications, human-machine interfaces, and emerging soft robotics.

abstract = {Currently, the manufacturing of self-actuating and self-sensing robots requires non-standard manufacturing techniques and assembly steps to integrate electrical and mechanical systems. In this work, we developed a novel manufacturing technique, where such robots can be produced at a flexible electronics factory. We developed the technique using standard industrial machines, processes, and materials. Using a lamination process, we were able to integrate air pouches or shape memory alloy (SMA) inside a polyamide-based flexible circuit to produce bending actuators. The bend angle of the actuators is sensed with a chain of inertial measurement units integrated on the actuator. Air-pouch actuators can produce a force of a 2.24N, and a maximum bend angle of 74 degrees. To demonstrate, we manufactured a five-legged robot with the developed actuators and bend sensors, with all the supporting electronics (e.g., microcontrollers, radio) directly integrated into the flexible printed circuit. Such robots are flat and lightweight (15 grams) and thus conveniently compact for transportation and storage.

abstract = {Abstract We describe an approach for the discrete and reversible assembly of tunable and actively deformable structures using modular building block parts for robotic applications. The primary technical challenge addressed by this work is the use of this method to design and fabricate low density, highly compliant robotic structures with spatially tuned stiffness. This approach offers a number of potential advantages over more conventional methods for constructing compliant robots. The discrete assembly reduces manufacturing complexity, as relatively simple parts can be batch-produced and joined to make complex structures. Global mechanical properties can be tuned based on sub-part ordering and geometry, because local stiffness and density can be independently set to a wide range of values and varied spatially. The structure's intrinsic modularity can significantly simplify analysis and simulation. Simple analytical models for the behavior of each building block type can be calibrated with empirical testi...},

abstract = {Muscle-based biohybrid actuators have generated significant interest as the future of biorobotics but so far they move without having much control over their actuation behavior. Integration of microelectrodes into the backbone of these systems may enable guidance during their motion and allow precise control over these actuators with specific activation patterns. Here, we addressed this challenge by developing aligned CNT forest microelectrode arrays and incorporated them into scaffolds for stimulating the cells. Aligned CNTs were successfully embedded into flexible and biocompatible hydrogel exhibiting excellent anisotropic electrical conductivity. Bioactuators were then engineered by culturing cardiomyocytes on the CNT microelectrode-integrated hydrogel constructs. The resulting cardiac tissue showed homogeneous cell organization with improved cell-to-cell coupling and maturation, which was directly related to the contractile force of muscle tissue. This centimeter-scale bioactuator has excellent mechanical integrity, embedded microelectrodes and is capable of spontaneous actuation behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a biohybrid machine can be controlled by an external electrical field provided by the integrated CNT microelectrode arrays. In addition, due to the anisotropic electrical conductivity of the electrodes provided from aligned CNTs, significantly different excitation thresholds were observed in different configurations such as the ones in parallel vs. perpendicular direction to the CNT alignment.},

KGaA, Weinheim Peristaltic crawling, which is the moving mechanism of earthworm-like limbless creatures in narrow spaces, is a challenging target to mimic by using soft materials. Here we report an unprecedented hydrogel actuator that enables not only a peristaltic crawling motion but also reversing its direction. Our cylindrically processed hydrogel contains gold nanoparticles for photothermal conversion, a thermoresponsive polymer network for switching the electrical permittivity of the gel interior, and cofacially oriented 2D electrolytes (titanate nanosheets; TiNSs) to synchronously change their anisotropic electrostatic repulsion. When a hydrogel, which was designed to include cofacially oriented TiNSs along the cylindrical gel axis, is pointwisely photoirradiated with a visible-light laser, it spatiotemporally expands immediately ({\textless}0.5 s) and largely (80 {\%} of its original length) in an isovolumetric manner. When the irradiation spot is moved along the cylindrical gel axis, the hydrogel undergoes peristaltic crawling due to quick and sequential elongation/contraction events and moves oppositely toward the laser scanning direction. Thus, when the scanning direction is switched, the crawling direction is reversed. When gold nanorods are used in place of gold nanoparticles, the hydrogel becomes responsive to a near-infrared light, which can deeply penetrate into bio tissues.},

We found that the electrical stimulus between a midrib and a lobe closes the Venus flytrap leaf by activating motor cells without mechanical stimulation of trigger hairs. The closing time of Venus flytrap by electrical stimulation of motor cells is 0.3 s, the same as mechanically induced closing. The mean electrical charge required for the closure of the Venus flytrap leaf is 13.6 $\mu$C. Ion channel blockers such as Ba2+, TEACI as well as uncouplers such as FCCP, 2,4-dinitrophenol and pentachlorophenol dramatically decrease the speed of the trap closing. Using an ultra-fast data acquisition system with measurements in real time, we found that the action potential in the Venus flytrap has a duration time of about 1.5 ms. Our results demonstrate that electrical stimulation can be used to study mechanisms of fast activity in motor cells of the plant kingdom. {\textcopyright}2007 Landes Bioscience.},

It is shown that, in general, the computed numerical values of the solution satisfy such analytic relations with poor accuracy. The aim of the paper is to show how the analytical relations can be satisfied in a stabilized manner in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the solution of the differential equations.

The basic idea is to tuck fold a planar paper to form a three-dimensional shape. The main contribution is to solve the inverse problem; the input is an arbitrary polyhedral surface and the output is the folding pattern. Our approach is to convert this problem into a problem of laying out the polygons of the surface on a planar paper by introducing the concept of tucking molecules. We investigate the equality and inequality conditions required for constructing a valid crease pattern. We propose an algorithm based on two-step mapping and edge splitting to solve these conditions. The two-step mapping precalculates linear equalities and separates them from other conditions. This allows an interactive manipulation of the crease pattern in the system implementation. We present the first system for designing three-dimensional origami, enabling a user can interactively design complex spatial origami models that have not been realizable thus far.},

Robotic assistance shows great potential in providing augmented motion precision and manipulation dexterity. This article reviews the robotic systems recently developed for SPL and NOTES. Material and methods: A literature search was conducted based on Science Citation Index, Engineering Index, Medline, and PubMed databases. Results: Eleven robotic systems for SPL and six robotic systems for NOTES were identified. Structures and performances of these systems were reported. Special attention was directed to the systems using continuum mechanisms. Discussion and conclusion: Regarding the structure aspect, the reviewed systems for SPL and NOTES all deploy a vision unit and at least two manipulation arms for surgical interventions through an access channel. To date, the smallest diameter of such a channel is 12 mm. Regarding the functionality aspect, only a few systems demonstrated results promising enough for animal or clinical studies in the near future. Surgical robots using dual continuum mechanisms achieved both design compactness and functional versatility. The characteristics suggest that the use of continuum mechanisms is worth exploring through future developments of surgical robots.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a data-driven motion control approach for a biomimetic robotic fish. The task of the motion control is to achieve desired motion by means of controlling the fish-like swimming gaits of the robot. Due to the complexity of hydrodynamics, it is impossible to derive an analytic model that can precisely describe the interaction between the robotic fish and surrounding water during motion. To address the lack of the robotic model, we explore data-based modeling and control design methods. First, through biomimetic learning from real fish motion data, a General Internal Model (GIM) is established. GIM translates fish undulatory body motion into robotic joint movement; associates the fish gait patterns, such as cruise and turning, with corresponding joint coordination; and adjusts the robotic velocity by GIM parameters. Second, by collecting robotic motion data at a set of operating points, we obtain the quantitative mapping from GIM tuning parameters to robotic speed. Third, applying the quantitative mapping and using GIM parameters as manipulating variables, a feedforward control is computed according to the desired speed, which greatly expedites the initial movement of the robotic fish. Fourth, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) is employed as feedback control, together with an inverse mapping that compensates for the nonlinearity appeared in the quantitative mapping. Fifth, modified Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) is developed as an appropriate data-driven tuning approach to determine controller gains. By switching between feedforward and feedback, the motion performance is improved. Finally, real-time control of robotic fish is implemented on a two-joint platform, and two representative swimming gaits, namely "cruise" and "cruise in turning", are achieved.},

Synthetic polymers and some natural materials are the most studied and utilized responsive soft materials for constructing structural color sensors, by tuning the thickness and morphology of formed films, or incorporating them into template structures, or their self-assembling. In this review article, structural colors in nature are firstly introduced, followed by discussing recent developments of promising responsive soft material-based structural color sensors, including the design of structural color sensors based on synthetic polymers and natural materials, as well as their applications for chemical sensing, biosensing, and multi-analyte sensing with sensor arrays. For specific sensing of chemicals and biomolecules, the sensing performance is evaluated in terms of detection range, sensitivity, response time, and selectivity. For multi-analyte sensing, cross-reactive structural sensor arrays based on simply a single soft material will be shown capable of discriminating various series of similar compounds. The future development of structural color sensors is also proposed and discussed.},

These include for instance minimally invasive surgery and assembly of microcomponents. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental analysis of a balloon-type compliant micro-actuator. Finite element modeling is used to describe the complex behavior of these actuators, which is validated through prototype experiments. Prototypes with dimensions ranging from 11mm × 2mm × 0.24mm to 4mm × 1mm × 0.12mm are fabricated by a newly developed production process based on micromilling and micromolding. The larger actuators are capable of delivering out-of-plane strokes of up to 7mm. Further, they have been integrated in a platform with two rotational and one translational degree of freedom. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Existing rapid prototyping techniques (e.g., 3-D printing) can achieve complex geometries and are becoming increasingly accessible; however, they are limited to one or two materials and cannot seamlessly integrate active components. We propose an alternative approach called printable robots that takes advantage of available planar fabrication methods to create integrated electromechanical laminates that are subsequently folded into functional 3-D machines employing origami-inspired techniques. We designed, fabricated, and tested prototype origami robots to address the canonical robotics challenges of mobility and manipulation, and subsequently combined these designs to generate a new, multifunctional machine.

An arbitrarily complex folding pattern can be used to yield an array of functionalities, in the form of actuated hinges or active spring elements. For actuation, we use compact NiTi coil actuators placed on the body to move parts of the structure on-demand.

In an earthworm, each individual metamere is actuated by circular and longitudinal muscles that are activated synchronously by the animal's nervous system. Here, adopting the basic functional principles of metameric worms, we propose a new pneumatically-driven soft robotic system that mimics the motions and replicates the functionality of a single burrowing earthworm's segment.

abstract = {Birds morph their wings during a single wingbeat, across flight speeds and among flight modes. Such morphing may allow them to maximize aerodynamic performance, but this assumption remains largely untested. We tested the aerodynamic performance of swept and extended wing postures of 13 raptor species in three families (Accipitridae, Falconidae and Strigidae) using a propeller model to emulate mid-downstroke of flapping during take-off and a wind tunnel to emulate gliding. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that (1) during flapping, wing posture would not affect maximum ratios of vertical and horizontal force coefficients (CV:CH), and that (2) extended wings would have higher maximum CV:CH when gliding. Contrary to each hypothesis, during flapping, extended wings had, on average, 31{\%} higher maximum CV:CHratios and 23{\%} higher CV than swept wings across all biologically relevant attack angles ($\alpha$), and, during gliding, maximum CV:CH ratios were similar for the two postures. Swept wings had 11{\%} higher CV than extended wings in gliding flight, suggesting flow conditions around these flexed raptor wings may be different from those in previous studies of swifts (Apodidae). Phylogenetic affiliation was a poor predictor of wing performance, due in part to high intrafamilial variation. Mass was only significantly correlated with extended wing performance during gliding. We conclude that wing shape has a greater effect on force per unit wing area during flapping at low advance ratio, such as takeoff, than during gliding.},

The Ni-rich titanium/nickel (TiNi) shape memory alloy (SMA) foil made by the newly developed ultrafine laminates method was used in order to produce the stent graft. The pattern of folds on the foil was produced by negative photochemical etching. The deployment of the stent graft is achieved either by SMA effect at the body temperature or by making use of property of superelasticity.

abstract = {Most animals exhibit significant neurological and morphological change throughout their lifetime. No robots to date, however, grow new morphological structure while behaving. This is due to technological limitations but also because it is unclear that morphological change provides a benefit to the acquisition of robust behavior in machines. Here I show that in evolving populations of simulated robots, if robots grow from anguilliform into legged robots during their lifetime in the early stages of evolution, and the anguilliform body plan is gradually lost during later stages of evolution, gaits are evolved for the final, legged form of the robot more rapidly--and the evolved gaits are more robust--compared to evolving populations of legged robots that do not transition through the anguilliform body plan. This suggests that morphological change, as well as the evolution of development, are two important processes that improve the automatic generation of robust behaviors for machines. It also provides an experimental platform for investigating the relationship between the evolution of development and robust behavior in biological organisms.},

abstract = {Numerical models of contracting muscle offer a powerful tool to study local mechanical load. For validation of these models, the spatial and temporal distribution of strain was quantified in fixed-end contracting rat tibialis anterior muscle in situ at optimal muscle length (Lo) and at 120° plantar flexion as well as at 125 and 33Hz stimulation frequency. We studied the hypothesis that after termination of stimulation in situ muscle segments near the motor endplates elongate while segments away from the endplates shorten. We show that both spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in muscle deformation occurred during contraction. Muscle plateau shortening strain equalled 4.1{\%}. Maximal plateau shortening of a muscle segment was much larger (9.6{\%}) and occurred distally (at 0.26 of the scaled length of the muscle). Manipulating torque levels by decreasing the stimulation frequency at the same muscle length induced a decrease in torque (∼20{\%}) with a smaller effect on the level and no effect on the pattern of muscle deformation. During relaxation, distal segments actively shortened at the expense of proximal muscle segments, which elongated. The segments undergoing lengthening were nearer to motor endplates than segments undergoing shortening. In conclusion, the present study provides experimental data on magnitude of contraction-induced deformation needed for validation of numerical models. Local muscle deformation is heterogeneous both temporally and spatially and may be related to proximity to the motor endplates. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Morphing, understood as the ability to undergo pronounced shape adaptations to optimally respond to a diversity of operational conditions, has been singled out as a future direction in the pursuit of maximised efficiency of lightweight structures. Whereas a certain degree of adaptivity can be accomplished conventionally by means of mechanical systems, compliance allowing for substantial reversible deformability exhibits far more potential as a morphing strategy. A promising solution to the inherent contradiction between high stiffness and reversible deformation capacity posed by morphing is offered by introducing variable stiffness components. This notion indicates the provision of a controllable range of deformation resistance levels in place of fixed properties, as required by real-time shape adaptation dictated by maximum efficiency under changing external conditions. With special emphasis on the morphing context, the current review aims to identify the main tendencies, undertaking a systematic classification of existing approaches involving stiffness variability. Four broad categories in which variable stiffness has been applied to morphing are therefore distinguished and detailed: material engineering, active mechanical design, semi-active techniques and elastic structural behaviour. Adopting a wide perspective, the study highlights key capabilities, limitations and challenges. The need for attention directed to the variable stiffness strategy is recognised and the significance of intensive research activities in a highly integrated and multidisciplinary environment emphasised if higher maturity stages of the concepts are to be reached. Finally, the potential of emerging directions of semi-active design involving electro-bonded laminates and multi-stable structures is brought into focus. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Furthermore, two ways of fabricating a multiple DOF robot are explored: casting the complete robot as a whole and casting single degree of freedom (DOF) segments with subsequent concatenation.

abstract = {Purpose – Virtual voxels (3D pixels) have traditionally been used as a graphical data structure for representing 3D geometry. The purpose of this paper is to study the use of pre-existing physical voxels as a material building-block for layered manufacturing and present the theoretical underpinnings for a fundamentally new massively parallel additive fabrication process in which 3D matter is digital. The paper also seeks to explore the unique possibilities enabled by this paradigm. Design/methodology/approach – Digital RP is a process whereby a physical 3D object is made of many digital units (voxels) arranged selectively in a 3D lattice, as opposed to analog (continuous) material commonly used in conventional rapid prototyping. The paper draws from fundamentals of 3D space-filling shapes, large-scale numerical simulation, and a survey of modern technology to reach conclusions on the feasibility of a fabricator for digital matter. Findings – Design criteria and appropriate 3D voxel geometries are presented that self-align and are suitable for rapid parallel assembly and economical manufacturing. Theory and numerical simulation predict dimensional accuracy to scale favorably as the number of voxels increases. Current technology will enable rapid parallel assembly of billions of microscale voxels. Research limitations/implications – Many novel voxel functions could be realized in the electromechanical and microfluidic domains, enabling inexpensive prototyping of complex 3D integrated systems. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of a 3D digital fabricator, but an instantiation is out of scope and left to future work. Practical implications – Digital manufacturing offers the possibility of desktop fabrication of perfectly repeatable, precise, multi-material objects with microscale accuracy. Originality/value – The paper constitutes a comprehensive review of physical voxel-based manufacturing and presents the groundwork for an emerging new field of additive manufacturing.},

The robotic fish consists of four links and three joints, and the driving forces are the torques applied to the joints. Considering kinematic constraints and hydrodynamic forces, Lagrangian formulation is used to obtain the dynamic model of the fish. Using this model, three major locomotion patterns of Anguilliform fish, including forward locomotion, backward locomotion and turning locomotion are investigated. It is found that the fish exhibits different locomotion patterns by giving different reference joint angles, such as adding reversed phase difference, or adding deflections to the original reference angles. The results are validated by both simulations and experiments. Furthermore, the relations among the speed of the fish, angular frequency, undulation amplitude, phase difference, as well as the relationship between the turning radius and deflection angle are investigated. These relations provide an elaborated motion library that can be used for motion planning of the robotic fish. {\textcopyright} 2013 Jilin University.},

The first topology (model 1) was constructed by adding two sinusoidal-shaped ribs into the classical re-entrant topology, while the second topology (model 2) was made by introducing extra vertical ribs to reinforce the sinusoidal-shaped ribs. Simulation results show that model 1 and model 2 topologies can reach a minimum value in Poisson's ratio of − 1.12 and − 0.58 with an appropriate geometric aspect ratio, respectively. The energy absorption capacities of model 1, model 2 and classical re-entrant model were studied at various compression velocities. Enhanced energy absorption capacities were observed in the two new re-entrant topologies compared with the classical re-entrant topology. Model 2 exhibited the highest energy absorption capacity and a highest plateau stress. The plateau stress of model 1 was about half that of model 2, and when the compression velocity is more than 20 m/s, the plateau stress of model 1 became lower than that of the classical re-entrant model.},

abstract = {Cononsolvency refers to the experimental finding that poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), PNIPAM, has a coil conformation in both pure water and pure methanol, at 20 °C and 1 atm, but assumes a globule conformation in methanol-water solutions, over the 0.1 ≤ X(MeOH) ≤ 0.4 methanol molar fraction. This strange phenomenon has recently been rationalized by claiming that: (a) MeOH molecules are able to bind two distant monomers in the chain, driving collapse [Nat. Commun., 2014, 5, 4882]; (b) the preferential binding of MeOH stabilizes globule conformations due to a conformational entropy gain of the chain [J. Phys. Chem. B, 2015, 119, 15780]. In the present work a self-consistent application of the approach already used to rationalize the effect of sodium salts, urea and tetramethylurea on PNIPAM collapse [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2015, 17, 27750; 2016, 18, 14426] leads to a different explanation. The emerging scenario is that cononsolvency is caused by the fact that, on adding methanol, the competition between water and methanol molecules to make attractive interactions with PNIPAM surface causes a decrease in the magnitude of attractive energy with respect to the pure water situation, for basic geometric reasons. Polymer chains collapse to reduce this geometric frustration.},

The effect of co-doping with lithium impurities on the thermoluminescence of various TL phosphors is also studied in dependence of Li concentration, of the chemical form of added lithium compounds and of the method of addition of Li co-dopant during the TL phosphor preparation. It is observed that the addition of Li co-dopant induces in some TL phosphors enhancement of the lower temperature peak which is correlated with the increase of TL sensitivity.

In order to stand on its own however, rather than a reaction to classical AI, the field of embodied AI must address why questions as well: why should body and brain both be considered when creating intelligent machines? This report provides three new lines of evidence for why the body plays an important role in cognition: (1) an autonomous robot must be able to adapt behavior in the face of drastic, unanticipated change to its body; (2) under-explored body plans raise new research questions related to cognition; and (3) optimizing body plans accelerates the automated design of intelligent machines, compared to leaving them fixed.},

In its ideal form the step comprises four phases of static posture alternating with four movements. Each movement is ushered in by a reversal of the contraction-relaxation relationships of one of the two pairs of opposing muscle systems. Four such changes are possible and they occur in a sequence that ensures the orderly succession of the four movements of protraction, swing back, retraction, and swing forward, of which movements the idealized stepping cycle is composed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}5. The actual locomotory step departs from the ideal form in two respects: (1) it is liable to become disrupted by a delay in the initiation of the protraction or of the backswing movement, and (2) withdrawal of the podium occurs simultaneously with its re-orientation in the forward direction. It is pointed out that these variations are explicable on the assumption that, in the two series of opposing muscle pairs, the retractor fibres are more readily excited to contract than are their antagonists, and the anterior postural muscles than the posterior postural fibres.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A central goal of synthetic biology is to achieve multi-signal integration and processing in living cells for diagnostic, therapeutic and biotechnology applications. Digital logic has been used to build small-scale circuits, but other frameworks may be needed for efficient computation in the resource-limited environments of cells. Here we demonstrate that synthetic analog gene circuits can be engineered to execute sophisticated computational functions in living cells using just three transcription factors. Such synthetic analog gene circuits exploit feedback to implement logarithmically linear sensing, addition, ratiometric and power-law computations. The circuits exhibit Weber's law behaviour as in natural biological systems, operate over a wide dynamic range of up to four orders of magnitude and can be designed to have tunable transfer functions. Our circuits can be composed to implement higher-order functions that are well described by both intricate biochemical models and simple mathematical functions. By exploiting analog building-block functions that are already naturally present in cells, this approach efficiently implements arithmetic operations and complex functions in the logarithmic domain. Such circuits may lead to new applications for synthetic biology and biotechnology that require complex computations with limited parts, need wide-dynamic-range biosensing or would benefit from the fine control of gene expression. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Running on water produces very energy-efficient and fast motion in water environments. Many studies have been performed to develop bio-inspired water-running robots. To achieve good performance, the lifting force is very important for a robot to be able to run on water. The loss of lifting force is associated with the rolling stability of the robot on water. The purpose of this study is to improve the rolling stability of a water-running robot through the periodic motion of a balancing tail. Kinematic analysis was performed to calculate the motions of the legs and the tail, and static analysis was performed to calculate the balancing effect of the tail motion. A numerical model was suggested to determine the dynamic performance of the robotic platform based on kinematic and static results. A simulation based on the numerical model was performed, and the results were compared with empirical data from a robot prototype. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data in terms of rolling stability The lifting force has only a slight effect. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for designing a stable water-running robot.},

abstract = {Human locomotion recognition methods based on electromyography (EMG) signals have not shown robust and accurate classification performance. This is due to the limitations of EMG signals such as its stochastic nature and sensitivity to placement of the sensors, as well as the number of sensors, feature extraction and classification algorithms. In this paper, a robust classification approach with only two features derived from EMG signals is developed to recognize locomotion activities and detect changing speeds. The root means square (RMS) and energy of the EMG signals are the features adopted in this method. The energy of the EMG signal is extracted using energy kernel method. The proposed approach uses a low number of sensors and features, online unsupervised classification, and is generalizable to different lower-limb muscle groups. To evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach, it is initially tested on a public dataset of five participants with two EMG sensors on biceps femoris and gastrocnemius, doing separate trials on the treadmill at various speeds and slopes. We performed additional experiments on two participants with EMG sensors on vastus laterialis and vastus medialis, as treadmill speeds changed online within each trial. The proposed approach achieved significant classification accuracy (above 90{\%}) using the standard unsupervised K-means clustering, for both locomotion activity and speed recognition with the public dataset and our collected data.},

abstract = {Soft robot arms possess unique capabilities when it comes to adaptability, flexibility, and dexterity. In addition, soft systems that are pneumatically actuated can claim high power-to-weight ratio. One of the main drawbacks of pneumatically actuated soft arms is that their stiffness cannot be varied independently from their end-effector position in space. The novel robot arm physical design presented in this article successfully decouples its end-effector positioning from its stiffness. An experimental characterization of this ability is coupled with a mathematical analysis. The arm combines the light weight, high payload to weight ratio and robustness of pneumatic actuation with the adaptability and versatility of variable stiffness. Light weight is a vital component of the inherent safety approach to physical human-robot interaction. To characterize the arm, a neural network analysis of the curvature of the arm for different input pressures is performed. The curvature-pressure rela-tionship is also characterized experimentally.},

However, these applications require fabrication methods capable of preparing complex, heterogeneous materials. Here we report a new approach for making patterned, multi-material and multi-responsive hydrogels, on a micrometre to millimetre scale. Nanolitre aqueous pre-gel droplets were connected through lipid bilayers in predetermined architectures and photopolymerized to yield continuous hydrogel structures. By using this droplet network technology to pattern domains containing temperature-responsive or non-responsive hydrogels, structures that undergo reversible curling were produced. Through patterning of gold nanoparticle-containing domains into the hydrogels, light-activated shape change was achieved, while domains bearing magnetic particles allowed movement of the structures in a magnetic field. To highlight our technique, we generated a multi-responsive hydrogel that, at one temperature, could be moved through a constriction under a magnetic field and, at a second temperature, could grip and transport a cargo.

Participants for the study were 128 male and 118 female students, ages 16 and 17 years, from 2 high schools in the western United States. Eight history classrooms were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 interventions: (a) traditional textbooks and content instruction, (b) traditional textbooks and heuristic instruction, (c) multiple texts and content instruction, or (d) multiple texts and heuristic instruction. The heuristic instruction explicitly taught sourcing, corroboration, and contextualization. Students were administered pretests on their content knowledge and their use of heuristics. After an intervention of 3 weeks, students were readministered the content knowledge and heuristics posttests. A mixed-model analysis of covariance indicated that across all conditions, students who read multiple texts scored higher on history content and used sourcing and corroboration more often than students who read traditional textbook material. Findings highlight the importance of reading multiple texts to deepen content knowledge and facilitate the use of heuristics that historians typically use.

abstract = {SignificanceFull-color displays are typically fabricated using a combination of chromatic materials of various types, introduced into an addressable pixel-based electronic device. Here we show that brightly colored, highly vivid pixels, directly suitable for RGB displays, can be fabricated using periodic areas of Al nanorods in each pixel. Both nanorod length and spacing are critically important in achieving strong and spectrally distinct scattering signatures across the visible spectrum. This use of a low-cost, abundant metal for achieving full-spectrum coloration is compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor manufacturing methods and directly applicable to current liquid crystal display technology. Aluminum is abundant, low in cost, compatible with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor manufacturing methods, and capable of supporting tunable plasmon resonance structures that span the entire visible spectrum. However, the use of Al for color displays has been limited by its intrinsically broad spectral features. Here we show that vivid, highly polarized, and broadly tunable color pixels can be produced from periodic patterns of oriented Al nanorods. Whereas the nanorod longitudinal plasmon resonance is largely responsible for pixel color, far-field diffractive coupling is used to narrow the plasmon linewidth, enabling monochromatic coloration and significantly enhancing the far-field scattering intensity of the individual nanorod elements. The bright coloration can be observed with p-polarized white light excitation, consistent with the use of this approach in display devices. The resulting color pixels are constructed with a simple design, are compatible with scalable fabrication methods, and provide contrast ratios exceeding 100:1.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} A submerged body subject to a sudden shape change experiences large forces due to the variation of added-mass energy. While this phenomenon has been studied for single actuation events, application to sustained propulsion requires the study of periodic shape change. We do so in this work by investigating a spring–mass oscillator submerged in quiescent fluid subject to periodic changes in its volume. We develop an analytical model to investigate the relationship between added-mass variation and viscous damping, and demonstrate its range of application with fully coupled fluid–solid Navier–Stokes simulations at large Stokes number. Our results demonstrate that the recovery of added-mass kinetic energy can be used to completely cancel the viscous damping of the fluid, driving the onset of sustained oscillations with amplitudes as large as four times the average body radius {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S0022112016003530{\_}inline1" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}r{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} .

The energetics of sustained flight for small aircraft, however, limit typical applications to only a few minutes. Adding payloads – and the mechanisms used to manipulate them – reduces this flight time even further. In this paper we present the flying monkey, a novel robot platform having three main capabilities: walking, grasping, and flight. This new robotic platform merges one of the world's smallest quadrotor aircraft with a lightweight, single-degree-of-freedom walking mechanism and an SMA-actuated gripper to enable all three functions in a 30 g package. The main goal and key contribution of this paper is to design and prototype the flying monkey that has increased mission life and capabilities through the combination of the functionalities of legged and aerial robots.},

These actuators are called "Hygroexpansive Electrothermal Paper Actuators" (HEPAs). The actuators are made from paper, conducting polymer, and adhesive tape. They are lightweight, inexpensive, and can be fabricated using simple printing techniques. The central element of the HEPAs is a porous conducting path (used to provide electrothermal heating) that changes the moisture content of the paper and causes actuation. This conducting path is made by embedding a conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS) within the paper, and thus making a paper/polymer composite that retains the porosity and hydrophilicity of paper. Different types of HEPAs (straight, precurved, and creased) achieved different types of motions (e.g., bending motion, accordion type motion). A theoretical model for their behavior is proposed. These actuators have been used for the manipulation of liquids and for the fabrication of an optical shutter.

abstract = {This paper proposes three design concepts for developing a crawling robot inspired by an inchworm, called the Omegabot. First, for locomotion, the robot strides by bending its body into an omega shape; anisotropic friction pads enable the robot to move forward using this simple motion. Second, the robot body is made of a single part but has two four-bar mechanisms and one spherical six-bar mechanism; the mechanisms are 2-D patterned into a single piece of composite and folded to become a robot body that weighs less than 1 g and that can crawl and steer. This design does not require the assembly of various mechanisms of the body structure, thereby simplifying the fabrication process. Third, a new concept for using a shape-memory alloy (SMA) coil-spring actuator is proposed; the coil spring is designed to have a large spring index and to work over a large pitch-angle range. This large-index-and-pitch SMA spring actuator cools faster and requires less energy, without compromising the amount of force and displacement that it can produce. Therefore, the frequency and the efficiency of the actuator are improved. A prototype was used to demonstrate that the inchworm-inspired, novel, small-scale, lightweight robot manufactured on a single piece of composite can crawl and steer.},

abstract = {Heavier-than-air flight at any scale is energetically expensive. This is greatly exacerbated at small scales and has so far presented an insurmountable obstacle for untethered flight in insect-sized (mass less than 500 milligrams and wingspan less than 5 centimetres) robots. These vehicles1–4 thus need to fly tethered to an offboard power supply and signal generator owing to the challenges associated with integrating onboard electronics within a limited payload capacity. Here we address these challenges to demonstrate sustained untethered flight of an insect-sized flapping-wing microscale aerial vehicle. The 90-milligram vehicle uses four wings driven by two alumina-reinforced piezoelectric actuators to increase aerodynamic efficiency (by up to 29 per cent relative to similar two-wing vehicles5) and achieve a peak lift-to-weight ratio of 4.1 to 1, demonstrating greater thrust per muscle mass than typical biological counterparts6. The integrated system of the vehicle together with the electronics required for untethered flight (a photovoltaic array and a signal generator) weighs 259 milligrams, with an additional payload capacity allowing for additional onboard devices. Consuming only 110–120 milliwatts of power, the system matches the thrust efficiency of similarly sized insects such as bees7. This insect-scale aerial vehicle is the lightest thus far to achieve sustained untethered flight (as opposed to impulsive jumping8 or liftoff9).},

Here we describe a chemomechanical system of this sort based on a synthetic polymer gel. The gel network is anionic, and positively charged surfactant molecules can therefore bind to its surface, inducing local shrinkage by decreasing the difference in osmotic pressure between the gel interior and the solution outside. By using an electric field to direct surfactant binding selectively to one side of the gel, we can induce contraction and curvature of a strip of gel. Reversing the direction of the field causes contraction of the opposite side, and when the gel is suspended in solution from a ratchet mechanism, it can thereby be made to move with a worm-like motion at a velocity of up to 25 cm min-1.},

Bistable compliant mechanisms provide a means to achieve this, and the goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility and design of a compliant bistable mechanism that is actuated by magneto active elastomer material. When exposed to an external field, magneto active elastomer material deforms to align embedded magnetic particles with the field. We investigate a case study using magneto active elastomer actuation through the development of finite element analysis models to predict the magnetic field required to snap the device from its first stable position to its second for various geometries and field strengths. The finite element analysis model also predicts the displacement of the mechanism as it moves from one position to the other to determine whether the device is in fact bistable. These results can be used to understand the relationship between the substrate properties and the bistability of the device. The experimental results validate the finite element analysis models and demonstrate the functionality of active magneto active elastomer materials to be used as actuators for such devices and applications of origami engineering.

Next, the existing mechanisms used for stimulating the printed actuators are described. In addition, the materials used to print the actuators are compared. Then, the applications of the printed actuators including soft-manipulation of tissues and organs in biomedicine and fragile agricultural products, regenerative design, smart valves, microfluidic systems, electromechanical switches, smart textiles, and minimally invasive surgical instruments are explained. After that, the reviewed 3D printed actuators are discussed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages considering power density, elasticity, strain, stress, operation voltage, weight, size, response time, controllability, and biocompatibility. Finally, the future directions of 3D printed actuators are discussed.},

The tremendous interest in self-shaping materials stems from a wide range of applications for these materials, ranging from biomedical devices to aircraft design. This review article highlights recent advances in understanding and designing thin, sheet-like soft materials that can transform into complex three-dimensional structures in a controlled manner by modulating the internal stresses. We review the general principles underlying shape transformation phenomena in natural and synthetic systems, and the significant achievements in fabricating self-shaping of soft materials via representative examples.

abstract = { Shape morphing is a critical aptitude for the survival of organisms and is determined by anisotropic tissue composition and directional orientation of micro- and nanostructures within cell walls, resulting in different swelling behaviors. Recent efforts have been dedicated to mimicking the behaviors that nature has perfected over billions of years. We present a robust strategy for preparing 3D periodically patterned single-component sodium alginate hydrogel sheets cross-linked with Ca 2+ ions, which can reversibly deform and be retained into various desirable inside-out shapes as triggered by biocompatible ions (Na + /Ca 2+ ). By changing the orientations of the patterned microchannels or triggering with Na + /Ca 2+ ions, various 3D twisting, tubular, and plant-inspired architectures can be facilely programmed. Not only can the transformation recover their initial shapes reversibly, but also it can keep the designated shapes without continuous stimuli. These inside-out 3D reversible ion-triggered hydrogel transformations shall inspire more attractive applications in tissue engineering, biomedical devices, and soft robotics fields. },

abstract = {Inspired by the shape deformations of plants with inhomogeneous structures, more and more attention has been paid to prepare deformable actuators with inhomogeneous structures and precisely program their shape deformations. Here, we report a simple and novel method to prepare graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide (GO/RGO) nanocomposite hydrogel-based deformable actuators by local electrochemical reduction of homogeneous poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/GO (PNIPAM/GO) hydrogels. GO nanosheets in PNIPAM/GO hydrogels can be reduced in an electrolytic cell made of two indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass plates, and local reduction can be realized by pasting patterned insulating stickers onto the cathodal ITO glass plate. The reduction of GO nanosheets leads to the breakage of hydrogen bonding between GO nanosheets and PNIPAM chains and hence lower cross-linking densities of the reduced regions. Therefore, the difference in the swelling/deswelling behaviors between the reduced and unreduced sides (or regions) enables the shape deformations of the PNIPAM/GO hydrogels, and their deformation degrees can be adjusted by changing their composition and thickness as well as the parameters of electrochemical reduction (e.g., applied voltage and reduction time). Very impressively, shape deformations from one-dimensional (1D) to two-dimensional (2D) and 2D to three-dimensional (3D) can be programmed by appropriate designing reduced regions on 1D hydrogel strips or 2D hydrogel sheets. As a representative example, a 3D "scorpion" with uplifted head/tail and an arched belly could deform from a 2D "scorpion" with the reduced head/tail on the same side and the reduced belly on the opposite side.},

Each microlens in the array is formed through an immiscible liquid?liquid interfacial meniscus. Here deionized water and silicone oil were used. The liquids were constrained in the PDMS structures fabricated through liquid-phase photopolymerization for molding and soft lithography. The microlenses were actuated by thermo-responsive N -isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) hydrogel microstructures and could be tuned individually by changing the local temperature. The NIPAAm hydrogels expanded and contracted, absorbing and releasing water, at different temperatures. Thus the pressure across the water?oil interface in the microlenses varied responding to the temperature, tuning their corresponding focal lengths. The microlens diameter was 2.4 mm. The typical microlens focal length was measured to be from 8 to 60 mm depending on the temperature. The microlens response time actuated by different structures and components of the NIPAAm hydrogels were compared. The normalized light intensities of the microlens focused spots were measured, matching well with a Zemax simulation, to study the microlens spherical aberrations. The NIPAAm hydrogel durability was also measured.},

The governing equation of the flexible tail was derived by using the Euler-Bernoulli theory. In this equation, the resistive forces were estimated as a term analogous to viscous damping. Then, the modal analysis method was applied in order to derive an analytical solution of the governing equation, by which the relationship between the driving moment and the lateral movement of the flexible tail was described. Finally, simulations and experiments were carried out and the results were compared to verify the accuracy of the dynamic model.

The problem consists in distributing a given amount of material in a specified domain modelled by a fixed finite element mesh in order to minimize the compliance. As the design variables can only take two values in- dicating the presence or absence of material (1 and 0), this prob- lem is intrinsically discrete. Here, it is solved by a mathemati- cal programming method working in the dual space and specially designed to handle discrete variables. This method is very well- suited to topology optimization, because it is particularly efficient for problems with a large number of variables and a small number of constraints. To ensure the existence of a solution, the perime- ter of the solid parts is bounded. A computer program including analysis and optimization has been developed. As it is specialized for regular meshes, the computational time is drastically reduced. Some classical 2-D and new 3-D problems are solved, with up to 30,000 design variables. Extensions to multiple load cases and to gravity loads are also examined.},

Both of the pectoral fins are built of eight electroactive polymer muscles. The experiments show that the fins are able to generate undulating motion and propel the body forward.

Interest in large-area networks of electronic devices inspired by human skin is motivated by the promise of creating autonomous intelligent robots and biomimetic prosthetics, among other applications. The development of electronic networks comprised of flexible, stretchable, and robust devices that are compatible with large-area implementation and integrated with multiple functionalities is a testament to the progress in developing an electronic skin (e-skin) akin to human skin. E-skins are already capable of providing augmented performance over their organic counterpart, both in superior spatial resolution and thermal sensitivity. They could be further improved through the incorporation of additional functionalities (e.g., chemical and biological sensing) and desired properties (e.g., biodegradability and self-powering). Continued rapid progress in this area is promising for the development of a fully integrated e-skin in the near future.},

The pattern of folds on the foil was produced by negative photochemical etching. The deployment of the stent graft is achieved either by SMA effect at the body temperature or by making use of property of superelasticity.

We demonstrate that a non-periodic cut pattern can cause a sheet to buckle into three-dimensional shapes, such as domes or patterns of wrinkles, when pulled at specific boundary points. These global buckling modes are observed in experiments and rationalized by an in-plane kinematic analysis that highlights the role of the geometric frustration arising from non-periodicity. The study focuses on elastic sheets, and is later extended to elastic-plastic materials to achieve shape retention. Our work illustrates a scalable route towards the fabrication of three-dimensional objects with nonzero Gaussian curvature from initially-flat sheets.},

abstract = {Origami engineering aims to combine origami principles with advanced materials to yield active origami shapes, which fold and unfold in response to external stimuli. This paper explores the potential and limitations of dielectric elastomers (DEs) as the enabling material in active origami engineering. DEs are compliant materials in which the coupled electro-mechanical actuation takes advantage of their low modulus and high breakdown strength. Until recently, prestraining of relatively thick DE materials was necessary in order to achieve the high electric fields needed to trigger electrostatic actuation without inducing a dielectric breakdown. Although prestrain improves the breakdown strength of the DE films and reduces the voltage required for actuation, the need for a solid frame to retain the prestrain state is a limitation for the practical implementation of DEs, especially for active origami structures. However, the recent availability of thinner DE materials (50 mu m, 130 mu m, 260 mu m) has made DEs a likely medium for active origami. In this work, the folding and unfolding of DE multilayered structures, along with the realization of origami-inspired 3D shapes, are explored. In addition, an exhaustive study on the fundamentals of DE actuation is done by directly investigating the thickness actuation mechanism and comparing their performance using different electrode types. Finally, changes in dielectric permittivity as a function of strain, electrode type and applied electric field are assessed and analyzed. These fundamental studies are key to obtaining more dramatic folding and to realizing active origami structures using DE materials.},

abstract = {Purpose - Virtual voxels (3D pixels) have traditionally been used as a graphical data structure for representing 3D geometry. The purpose of this paper is to study the use of pre-existing physical voxels as a material building-block for layered manufacturing and present the theoretical underpinnings for a fundamentally new massively parallel additive fabrication process in which 3D matter is digital. The paper also seeks to explore the unique possibilities enabled by this paradigm. Design/methodology/approach - Digital RP is a process whereby a physical 3D object is made of many digital units (voxels) arranged selectively in a 3D lattice, as opposed to analog (continuous) material commonly used in conventional rapid prototyping. The paper draws from fundamentals of 3D space-filling shapes, large-scale numerical simulation, and a survey of modern technology to reach conclusions on the feasibility of a fabricator for digital matter. Findings - Design criteria and appropriate 3D voxel geometries are presented that self-align and are suitable for rapid parallel assembly and economical manufacturing. Theory and numerical simulation predict dimensional accuracy to scale favorably as the number of voxels increases. Current technology will enable rapid parallel assembly of billions of microscale voxels. Research limitations/implications - Many novel voxel functions could be realized in the electromechanical and microfluidic domains, enabling inexpensive prototyping of complex 3D integrated systems. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of a 3D digital fabricator, but an instantiation is out of scope and left to future work. Practical implications - Digital manufacturing offers the possibility of desktop fabrication of perfectly repeatable, precise, multi-material objects with microscale accuracy. Originality/value - The paper constitutes a comprehensive review of physical voxel-based manufacturing and presents the groundwork for an emerging new field of additive manufacturing. {\textcopyright} 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The light-induced actuation arises from the sliding motion of the [c2]daisy chain unit. Ultraviolet irradiation caused the gels to bend towards the light source. The response of the [c2]AzoCD2 xerogel, even under dry conditions, is very fast (7° every second), which is 10,800 times faster than the [c2]AzoCD2 hydrogel (7° every 3 h).

Multi-backbone continuum robots allow to estimate forces and torques at the operational point by monitoring loads along their actuation lines without the need for a dedicated transducer at the operational point. This capability is indeed crucial in emerging fields such as robotic surgery where cost and strict sterilization guidelines prevent the adoption of a dedicated sensor to provide force feedback from the sterile field. To advance further the force sensing capabilities of multi-backbone continuum robots, we present a new framework for hybrid motion and force control of continuum robots with intrinsic force sensing capabilities. The framework is based on a kinetostatic modeling of the multi-backbone continuum robot with, a simplified model for online estimate of the manipulator's compliance, and a new strategy for merging force and motion control laws in the configuration space of the manipulator. Experimental results show the ability to sense and regulate forces at the operational point and evaluate the framework for shape exploration and stiffness imaging in flexible environments.},

abstract = {Advances in fabrication technologies are enabling the production of architected materials with unprecedented properties. Most such materials are characterized by a fixed geometry, but in the design of some materials it is possible to incorporate internal mechanisms capable of reconfiguring their spatial architecture, and in this way to enable tunable functionality. Inspired by the structural diversity and foldability of the prismatic geometries that can be constructed using the snapology origami technique, here we introduce a robust design strategy based on space-filling tessellations of polyhedra to create three-dimensional reconfigurable materials comprising a periodic assembly of rigid plates and elastic hinges. Guided by numerical analysis and physical prototypes, we systematically explore the mobility of the designed structures and identify a wide range of qualitatively different deformations and internal rearrangements. Given that the underlying principles are scale-independent, our strategy can be applied to the design of the next generation of reconfigurable structures and materials, ranging from metre-scale transformable architectures to nanometre-scale tunable photonic systems.},

abstract = {Creating complex spatial objects from a flat sheet of material using origami folding techniques has attracted atten- tion in science and engineering. In the present work, we use the geometric properties of partially folded zigzag strips to better describe the kinematics of known zigzag/herringbone-base folded sheet metamaterials such as Miura-ori. Inspired by the kinematics of a one–degree of freedom zigzag strip, we introduce a class of cellular folded mechanical metamaterials comprising different scales of zigzag strips. This class of patterns combines origami folding techniques with kirigami. Using analytical and numerical models, we study the key mechanical properties of the folded materials. We show that our class of patterns, by expanding on the design space of Miura-ori, is appropriate for a wide range of applications from mechanical metamaterials to deployable structures at small and large scales. We further show that, depending on the geometry, these materials exhibit either negative or positive in-plane Poisson's ratios. By introducing a class of zigzag-base materials in the current study, we unify the concept of in-plane Poisson's ratio for similar materials in the literature and extend it to the class of zigzag- base folded sheet materials.},

The proposed manipulator is based on a series of identical modules, each one consisting of a silicone tube with pneumatic chambers for allowing 3D motion and one central channel for the implementation of the granular jamming phenomenon for stiffening. The silicone is covered by a novel bellows-shaped braided structure maximizing the bending still limiting lateral expansion. In this paper one single module is tested in terms of bending range, elongation capability, generated forces and stiffness changing.},

The main advantage of the model is its ability to solve inhomogeneous deformations due to a stable behavior in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature. Therefore, inhomogeneous swelling of a spherical shell on a hard core with application to microfluidics is analytically and numerically investigated for various thicknesses of the shell.

There is a large body of work simulating compliant mechanisms. These normally assume small deformations with homogeneous material properties actuated with external forces. There is also a large body of research on physically-based deformable objects for applications in computer graphics with the purpose of generating realistic appearances at the expense of accuracy. Here we present a simulation framework in which an object may be composed of any number of interspersed materials with varying properties (stiffness, density, etc.) to enable true heterogeneous multi-material simulation. Collisions are handled to prevent self-penetration due to large deformation, which also allows multiple bodies to interact. A volumetric actuation method is implemented to impart motion to the structures which opens the door to the design of novel structures and mechanisms. The simulator was implemented efficiently such that objects with thousands of degrees of freedom can be simulated at suitable framerates for user interaction using a single thread of a typical desktop computer. The code is written in platform agnostic C++ and is fully open source. This research opens the door to the dynamic simulation of freeform 3D multi-material mechanisms and objects in a manner suitable for design automation.},

abstract = {Biomechanics of morphing structures in the Venus flytrap has attracted the attention of scientists during the last 140 years. The trap closes in a tenth of a second if a prey touches a trigger hair twice. The driving force of the closing process is most likely due to the elastic curvature energy stored and locked in the leaves, which is caused by a pressure differential between the upper and lower layers of the leaf. The trap strikes, holds and compresses the prey. We have developed new methods for measuring all these forces involved in the hunting cycle. We made precise calibration of the piezoelectric sensor and performed direct measurements of the average impact force of the trap closing using a high speed video camera for the determination of time constants. The new equation for the average impact force was derived. The impact average force between rims of two lobes in the Venus flytrap was found equal to 149. mN and the corresponding pressure between the rims was about 41. kPa. Direct measurements of the constriction force in the trap of Dionaea muscipula was performed during gelatin digestion. This force increases in the process of digestion from zero to 450. mN with maximal constriction pressure created by the lobes reaching to 9. kPa. The insects and different small prey have little chance to escape after the snap of the trap. The prey would need to overpower the "escaping" force which is very strong and can reach up to 4.

Herein, a new strategy to concurrently fabricate hybrid ionic–covalent {\{}DN{\}} hydrogels and modulate their structures and mechanics is reported, in which an in situ formed chitosan ionic network is incorporated by post‐crosslinking the chitosan‐based composite hydrogel using multivalent anions solutions. The obtained hybrid {\{}DN{\}} hydrogels exhibit predominant mechanical properties including superior elastic modulus, high tensile strength, and ultrahigh fracture energy because of the more efficient energy dissipation of rigid short‐chain chitosan network. Notably, the swollen hydrogels still remain mechanically strong and tough even after immersion in water for 24 h. More significantly, simply changing the post‐crosslinking time can vary the compactness and rigidity of the chitosan network in situ, achieving flexible and efficient modulation of the structures and mechanics of the hybrid {\{}DN{\}} hydrogels. This study opens up a new horizon in the preparation and regulation of {\{}DN{\}} hydrogels for promising applications in tissue scaffolds, actuators, and wearable devices.

This has been termed 4D printing, with the 4th dimension being the time-dependent shape change after the printing. In this paper, we advance the 4D printing concept to the design and fabrication of active origami, where a flat sheet automatically folds into a complicated 3D component. Here we print active composites with shape memory polymer fibers precisely printed in an elastomeric matrix and use them as intelligent active hinges to enable origami folding patterns. We develop a theoretical model to provide guidance in selecting design parameters such as fiber dimensions, hinge length, and programming strains and temperature. Using the model, we design and fabricate several active origami components that assemble from flat polymer sheets, including a box, a pyramid, and two origami airplanes. In addition, we directly print a 3D box with active composite hinges and program it to assume a temporary flat shape that subsequently recovers to the 3D box shape on demand.},

The C2C12 myoblasts were seeded on the collagen film, where they proliferated and formed myotubes after induction of differentiation. When C2C12 myotubes were stimulated with electric pulses, contraction of the collagen film-C2C12 myotube complex was observed.

We quantify this shape in terms of the radius of the circle, the dihedral angle of the fold, and the mechanical properties of the sheet of paper and the fold itself. When the sheet is isometrically deformed everywhere except along the fold itself, stiff folds result in creases with constant curvature and oscillatory torsion. However, relatively softer folds inherit the broken symmetry of the buckled shape with oscillatory curvature and torsion. Our asymptotic analysis of the isometrically deformed state is corroborated by numerical simulations that allow us to generalize our analysis to study structures with multiple curved creases. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Various robotic applications including surgical instruments, wearable robots and autonomous mobile robots are often constrained with strict design requirements on high degrees of freedom (DoF) and minimal volume and weight. An intuitive design to meet these contradictory requirements is to embed locking mechanism in under actuated robotic manipulators to direct the actuation from a single and remote source to drive different joints on demand. Mechanical clutches do serve such purposes but often are bulky and require auxiliary mechanism making it difficult to justify the high cost adding the additional DoF, especially in cm scale. Here, we introduce an under-actuated robotic arm with shape memory polymer (SMP) joints. Through controlling the temperature, the stiffness of the joints can be adjusted and selected joints will be activated while the rest are fixed in their position. The presented prototype can control the joints independently with a coupled actuation from two stepper motors. Since we have redundant DoFs in the arm, there can be more than one configuration to reach a given position. We use a probabilistic technique to determine the optimum configuration with the minimum number of active joints that can yield the desired posture. In this paper, we report on the performance of the proposed design for the hardware and the configuration planner.},

abstract = {A key step along the way to understanding the natural motion is producing a physical, well understood actuator with a dynamic model closely resembling biological muscle. This actuator can then serve as the basis for building viable, full-strength, and safe muscles for disabled patients, human force amplification, and humanoid robotic systems. This paper presents an expanded fingerprint method for calculating the dynamic equations of motion for cellular actuator arrays, an actuator technology which combines many small flexible 'cell' actuator units for large-scale motion. The new method is simpler and quicker than generating the dynamic equations of motion from base principles, allows for fast recalculation for different and immense cell array structures, and provides an intuitive base for future controls work on cell array actuators. The paper also presents a physical SMA based cellular actuator array which, when compared with simulated results, matches the presented theory closely. Finally a brief discussion about the uses of the expanded fingerprint method, including controls and design work in robotics, is given. In the future, the theory will be used and extended to develop high degree-of-freedom cellular array actuated robotic devices with natural motion for use in rehabilitation, prosthesis development, human force amplification, and general robotics. These new devices will be especially effective at working safely around and with humans in complex human environments.},

With the development of microfluidic applications, hydrogels can be integrated into microfluidic systems by soft lithography, flow-solid processes or UV cure methods. Due to their special properties, hydrogels are widely used as fluid control modules, biochemical reaction modules or biological application modules in different applications. Although hydrogels have been used in microfluidic systems for more than ten years, many hydrogels' properties and integrated techniques have not been carefully elaborated. Here, we systematically review the physical properties of hydrogels, general methods for gel-microfluidics integration and applications of this field. Advanced topics and the outlook of hydrogel fabrication and applications are also discussed. We hope this review can help researchers choose suitable methods for their applications using hydrogels.},

@article{Hu2018a,
abstract = {due to hydrophobic association upon heating and dissociate upon cooling. [6] Thus, in order to realize cooling-triggered shape recovery, we designed a double network hydrogel comprised of (i) a loose covalent network that stores elastic energy upon deformation and (ii) a reversible network of hydrophobic crosslinks that fixes a temporary shape upon heating. The permanent shape is recovered by cooling due to weakening of the hydrophobic interactions and subsequent dissociation of the temporary network. This cooling-triggered shape recovery provides not only a viable shape-memory actuator for biomedical applications, but also enables novel opportunities for cold weather applications. [7] As proof of concept, we synthesized hydrogels (76 wt{\%} water) by copolymerizing acrylamide (AAm) with a low concentration of chemical crosslinker, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (NMBA), in the presence of linear methylcellulose (MC) under UV light at 10 °C (Figure 1a). The hydrophobic methoxy group in the MC anhydro-d-glucose repeat unit (Figure 1a) [8] ensures solubility in cold water and gelation upon heating (Figure S1, Supporting Information). [9] At low temperature (20 °C), water molecules form clathrates around the hydrophobic methoxy groups, which result in hydration of MC chains and reduce chain interaction to mere entanglement. [10] As shown in Figure 1b (inset), the PAAm18-MC6 (18 wt{\%} PAAm and 6 wt{\%} MC) hydrogel is transparent at 20 °C and turns opaque upon heating to 65 °C. The opacity is caused by aggregation of the hydrophobic groups due to entropy-driven disassembly of clathrates. [8] The reversible formation of a physical network is evidenced by uniaxial tensile tests conducted at 20 and 65 °C (Figure 1b). At the lower temperature (20 °C), the PAAm18-MC6 hydrogel demonstrates lower modulus (28 kPa) and higher strain-at-break (≈1800{\%}) due to lower crosslink density. Within a strain limit of 300{\%}, the first loading-unloading cycle exhibits a good elasticity (as required for shape recovery) with a small residual strain of 30{\%} and a hysteresis of 20 kJ m −3 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). At the higher temperature (65 °C), the strain-at-break decreases to 400{\%}, while the modulus increases to 115 kPa (as required for shape fixation) due to aggregation of the hydro-phobic units and the resulting increase of crosslink density. [11] The first deformation cycles exhibit a much larger hysteresis of 320 kJ m −3 and a residual strain of 100{\%}, which suggest significant energy dissipation upon breaking hydrophobic crosslinks during stretching. Similar to other systems with sacrificial bonds, the residual strain and hysteresis do not change too much in the consecutive loading-unloading cycles. [12] Heating-triggered shape actuation is vital for biomedical applications. The likely overheating and subsequent damage of surrounding tissue, however, severely limit its utilization in vivo. Herein, cooling-triggered shapeshifting is achieved by designing dual-network hydrogels that integrate a permanent network for elastic energy storage and a reversible network of hydrophobic crosslinks for "freezing" temporary shapes when heated. Upon cooling to 10 °C, the hydrophobic interactions weaken and allow recovery of the original shape, and thus programmable shape alterations. Further, multiple temporary shapes can be encoded independently at either different temperatures or different times during the isothermal network formation. The ability of these hydrogels to shapeshift at benign conditions may revolutionize biomedical implants and soft robotics.},

Through novel structure design based on multisegment dielectric elastomer minimum energy structure, the robot appears to be a fully flexible circular configuration with excellent ability of active deformation for its body controlled by applied voltages. An equivalent pseudo-rigid-body model is developed to provide an effective analysis for the deformation and rolling mechanism. The detailed fabrication process is described, and then a robot prototype is fabricated. The resulting RSR weighs 0.88 g with a diameter of 49.66 mm, which exhibits uniquely advantageous properties including low mass, mechanical flexibility and resilience, silent operation, and fast response. Controlled by three sequential open-loop control signals generated by a developed multiplex high-voltage control system, the robot prototype can realize continuous and steady rolling locomotion on flat ground. The response time of active deformation and restoration of the robot is less than 50 ms, the speed-mass ratio is about 41.22 mm/(s{\textperiodcentered}g) and the maximum speed-diameter ratio reaches approximately 0.95 s -1 . Compared with the previous similar rolling soft robots, our robot demonstrates higher rolling speed and larger speed-mass ratio, which can find potential future use in scouting and exploration missions.},

abstract = {Soft, wearable or printable strain sensors derived from conductive polymer nanocomposites (CPNs) are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in personal-care applications. Common elastomers employed in the fabrication of such piezoresistive CPNs frequently rely on chemically cross-linked polydiene or polysiloxane chemistry, thereby generating relatively inexpensive and reliable sensors that become solid waste upon application termination. Moreover, the shape anisotropy of the incorporated conductive nanoparticles can produce interesting electrical effects due to strain-induced spatial rearrangement. In this study, we investigate the morphological, mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical properties of CPNs generated from thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) triblock copolymer systems containing vapor-grown carbon nanofiber (CNF). Modulus-tunable TPE gels imbibed with a midblock-selective aliphatic oil exhibit well-behaved properties with increasing CNF content, but generally display nonlinear negative piezoresistance at different strain amplitudes and stretch rates due to nanofiber mobility upon CPN strain-cycling. In contrast, a neat TPE possessing low hard-block content yields a distinctive strain-reversible piezoresistive response, as well as low electrical hysteresis, upon cyclic deformation. Unlike their chemically cross-linked analogs, these physically cross-linked and thus environmentally benign CPNs are fully reprocessable by thermal and/or solvent means.},

abstract = {The contractility of tissue-engineered muscle on the application of electrical signals is required for the development of bio-actuators and for muscle tissue regeneration. Investigations have already reported on the contraction of myotubes differentiated from myoblasts and the construction of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle using electrical pulses. However, the relationship between myotube contraction and electrical pulses has not been quantitatively evaluated. We quantitatively investigated the effect of electrical pulse frequency on the excitability of myotubes and developed bio-actuators made of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle. C2C12 cells were seeded on a collagen-coated dish and in collagen gel and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10{\%} fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. When the cells reached confluence or after 2 days in culture, the medium was shifted to DMEM containing 7{\%} horse serum to allow them to differentiate to C2C12 myotubes. We electrically stimulated the myotubes and tissue-engineered skeletal muscle, and contractions were observed under a microscope. The myotubes contracted synchronously with electrical pulses between 0.5 and 5 Hz and unfused tetanus was generated at 10 Hz. The contractile performance of tissue-engineered skeletal muscle made of collagen gel and C2C12 was similar to that of the myotubes. Both the rheobase and chronaxie of the myotubes were lowest when the electric field was applied parallel to the myotube axis, and the values were 8.33 +/- 2.78 mA and 1.19 +/- 0.38 ms, respectively. The motion of C2C12 myotube contraction depended on the pulse frequency and showed anisotropy in the electric field. These results suggest that a tissue-engineered bio-actuator may be controlled using electrical signals.},

Towards this goal, photolatently reactive hydrogels are very promising. Here we develop photolatently modulable hydrogels, composed of a polymer network accommodating photocatalytic titania nanosheets at every crosslinking point. As titania nanosheets can utilize gelling water as their source of radicals, its long-lasting photocatalysis makes the hydrogels readily modulable. Benefiting from the hydrogelation mechanism, the gel network is finely compartmentalized, leading to sharp thermoresponses. As demonstrated by photo-micropatterning, non-diffusible titania nanosheets at the crosslinking points enable pointwise modulations with an excellent spatial resolution. The photolatent nature also makes it possible to conjugate them with other hydrogels and polymers.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first practical method for "origamizing" or obtaining the folding pattern that folds a single sheet of material into a given polyhedral surface without any cut. The basic idea is to tuck fold a planar paper to form a three-dimensional shape. The main contribution is to solve the inverse problem; the input is an arbitrary polyhedral surface and the output is the folding pattern. Our approach is to convert this problem into a problem of laying out the polygons of the surface on a planar paper by introducing the concept of tucking molecules. We investigate the equality and inequality conditions required for constructing a valid crease pattern. We propose an algorithm based on two-step mapping and edge splitting to solve these conditions. The two-step mapping precalculates linear equalities and separates them from other conditions. This allows an interactive manipulation of the crease pattern in the system implementation. We present the first system for designing three-dimensional origami, enabling a user can interactively design complex spatial origami models that have not been realizable thus far.},

Recent advances in the mechanistic understanding of biosynthetic compound materials, computer-aided design approaches in molecular synthetic biology 4,5 and traditional soft robotics, and increasing aptitude in generating structural and chemical micro environments that promote cellular self-organization have enhanced the ability to recapitulate such hierarchical architecture in engineered biological systems. Here we combined these capabilities in a systematic design strategy to reverse engineer a muscular pump. We report the construction of a freely swimming jellyfish from chemically dissociated rat tissue and silicone polymer as a proof of concept. The constructs, termed 'medusoids', were designed with computer simulations and experiments to match key determinants of jellyfish propulsion and feeding performance by quantitatively mimicking structural design, stroke kinematics and animal-fluid interactions. The combination of the engineering design algorithm with quantitative benchmarks of physiological performance suggests that our strategy is broadly applicable to reverse engineering of muscular organs or simple life forms that pump to survive.},

It is shown that both lever and traction methods can be used according to circumstances. When the starfish is walking on a horizontal surface it is shown that the tube feet certainly act as struts and that they probably also act as levers. When the starfish is climbing upon a vertical surface (or meeting with resistance upon a horizontal surface) the tube feet attach themselves to the substratum and form a traction system.},

The volume phase transition temperature of PNIPA hydrogels was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The swelling ratios of the hydrogels at different temperatures were measured. Furthermore, the deswelling kinetics of the hydrogels was also studied by measuring their water retention capacity. In comparison with a conventional PNIPA hydrogel prepared in water, the hydrogel synthesized in aqueous hydroxyl-propyl-methyl cellulose solution has higher swelling ratios at temperatures below the lower critical solution temperature and exhibits a much faster response rate to temperature changes. For example, the hydrogel made in aqueous hydroxyl-propyl-methyl cellulose solution lost 89{\%} water within 1 min and about 93{\%} water in 4 min, whereas the conventional hydrogel lost only about 66{\%} water in 15 min from the deswelling measurement in similar conditions. {\textcopyright} Higher Education Press 2007.},

abstract = {Environmentally responsive (ER) hydrogels are hydrogels that can experience an abrupt volume change and hence hold or release a large amount of water under the change of certain environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, or an electric field. Because of their unique capability to achieve a large yet reversible volume change, hydrogels have been widely used in microfluidics and biomedical applications, such as hydrogel sensors and actuators for microfluidic channels, novel drug delivery systems, and scaffolding materials for tissue engineering. In most applications, ER hydrogels are used to create an isotropic volume change or one-dimensional motion by constraining the hydrogel in the other two directions. In this study, using finite element based simulations, actuator designs are demonstrated that can generate a variety of shape changes by carefully patterning ER hydrogels on a non-ER hydrogel matrix. In these designs, as the environment changes, the ER hydrogels undergo volume change under the constraints imposed by the non-ER matrix, causing an eigenstrain (mismatch strain) and hence the deformation of the non-ER matrix. By properly controlling the locations of the ER hydrogel sections with respect to the non-ER hydrogel matrix, one can achieve a desired deformation of the composite structure. As examples, designs of a single material actuator, one linear spring composite actuator, and two coil composite actuators are demonstrated. The feasibility to produce these actuators and the possible applications are discussed at the end of the article.},

Therefore, the combination of both provides endless possibilities for tasks, such as espionage, pollution and marine wildlife surveillance, and border protection. Applying bioinspiration and biomimetics not only camouflages the robot, but also increases the efficiency of already perfected designs. Because bioinspiration and aerial-aquatic locomotion are the main attraction for this article, this review gathers the characteristics of aerial-aquatic animals useful for such designs. These animals are diving birds and flying fish, specifically plunge-diving birds, surface-diving birds, both plunge- and surface-diving birds, two-winger flying fish, and four-winger flying fish. The overview of the current marine bioinspired and non-bioinspired robots that are both aerial and aquatic are also presented, followed by the limitations and recommendations of the bioinspired robots. It is shown by a comparison between the bioinspired robot and its corresponding animal that the existing robotic systems are not truly bioinspired. The main traits these systems are missing are replicating the exact weight, size, muscle movement, and skin texture of the biological animal. In order to have efficient robots, bioinspiration needs to be perfected. Doing so requires not only the basic design to be replicated, but every detail of the system to be imitated.},

In flight, the actively morphing of bat wing includes the twisting from wing root to wing tip, the cambering along the chordwise direction, the bending along the spanwise direction and the wing area-changing caused by the stretch and retraction of the wingspan. It was found that the high thrust and lift required in bat flight are dependent on the wing twisting and cambering respectively. Moreover, the integrated wing-morphing generates the aerodynamic lift and thrust mainly during the downstroke and almost negligible forces during the upstroke. The wing area-changing and bending can be used to amplify the positive forces in the downstroke duration and reduce the negative forces in the upstroke duration.},

Other features of the hand include an integrated sensing suite that uses a common transduction technology on flexible printed circuits for tactile and proprioceptive sensing. The hand is analyzed using a three-dimensional rigid body analysis package with efficient simulation of compliant mechanisms and contacts with friction. This package allows one to evaluate design tradeoffs among link lengths, required tendon tensions, spring stiffnesses and braking requirements to grasp and hold a wide range of objects.

This undulating fin is a segmental anal fin that produces sinusoidal wave to propel the robot. The relationship between the individual fin segment and phase angles with the overall fin trajectory has also been discussed. This propulsive force can be adjusted and directed for fish robot manoeuvre by a mechanical system with two servomotors. These servomotors regulate the direction and depth of swimming. A wireless remote control system is designed to adjust the servomotors which enables us to control revolution, speed and phase differences of neighbor servomotors of fins.

abstract = {Thin sheets have long been known to experience an increase in stiffness when they are bent, buckled, or assembled into smaller interlocking structures. We introduce a unique orientation for coupling rigidly foldable origami tubes in a "zipper" fashion that substantially increases the system stiffness and permits only one flexible deformation mode through which the structure can deploy. The flexible deployment of the tubular structures is permitted by localized bending of the origami along prescribed fold lines. All other deformation modes, such as global bending and twisting of the structural system, are substantially stiffer because the tubular assemblages are overconstrained and the thin sheets become engaged in tension and compression. The zipper-coupled tubes yield an unusually large eigenvalue bandgap that represents the unique difference in stiffness between deformation modes. Furthermore, we couple compatible origami tubes into a variety of cellular assemblages that can enhance mechanical characteristics and geometric versatility, leading to a potential design paradigm for structures and metamaterials that can be deployed, stiffened, and tuned. The enhanced mechanical properties, versatility, and adaptivity of these thin sheet systems can provide practical solutions of varying geometric scales in science and engineering.},

abstract = {Activated polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers, which are suitably annealed, cross-linked and hydrolyzed, are known to contract and elongate when immersed in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. The key engineering features of PAN fibers are its capability of changing length more than 100 percent and its comparable strength to human muscle. A new technique that allows one to electrically control the actuation of active PAN fiber bundles is reported here. Increasing the conductivity of PAN fibers by making a composite of them with a conductive medium such as platinum, gold, graphite, carbon nanotubes and fibers by making a composite of them with a conductive medium such as platinum, gold, graphite, carbon nanotubes and conductive polymers such as polyaniline or polypyrrole has allowed for electric activation of PAN fibers when a conductive polyacrylonitrile (C-PAN) fiber bundle is placed in a chemical electrolysis cell as an electrode. A change in pH in the vicinity of C-PAN fiber electrode leads to contraction and expansion of C-PAN fibers depending upon the applied electric field polarity. Typically close to 100 percent change in C-PAN length in a few seconds is observed in a weak electrolyte solution with 10s of VDC power supply. These results indicate a great potential in developing electrically activated C-PAN muscles and linear actuators, as well as integrated pairs of antagonistic muscles and muscle sarcomere and myosin/actin assembly. This technology would be more applicable to realistic situations than that of chemically activated PAN fiber bundles as artificial muscles. These results present an excellent potential for using electrically activated C- PAN as artificial sarcomere and artificial muscle.},

The modulation was achieved by limiting the interpenetration of part of one gel network with another gel network. The gels so produced have an internally heterogeneous or modulated structure. Three simple applications based on the modulated gels are described here: a bigel strip, a shape memory gel, and a gel "hand." The bigel strip bends almost to a circle in response to a temperature increase or an increase in solvent concentration. The shape memory gel changes its shape from a straight line to a pentagon to a quadrangle as the temperature increases. These transitions from one shape to another are reversible.

abstract = {Inspired by the intrinsic softness and the corresponding embodied intelligence principles, soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) have been developed, which ensure safe interaction in unstructured, unknown environments. Due to their intrinsic softness, these actuators have the ability to resist large mechanical impacts. However, the soft materials used in these structures are in general susceptible to damage caused by sharp objects found in the unstructured environments. This paper proposes to integrate a self-healing (SH-) mechanism in SPAs, such that cuts, tears and perforations in the actuator can be self-healed. Diels-Alder (DA-) polymers, covalent polymer network systems based on the thermoreversible DA-reaction, were selected and their mechanical, as well as SH-properties, are described. To evaluate the feasibility of developing an SPA constructed out of SH-material, a single cell prototype, a SH-soft pneumatic cell (SH-SPC), was constructed entirely out of DA-polymers. Exploiting the SH-property of the DA-polymers, a completely new shaping process is presented in this paper, referred to as 'shaping through folding and self-healing'. 3D polygon structures, like the cubic SH-SPC, can be constructed by folding SH-polymer sheet. The sides of the structures can be sealed and made airtight using a SH-procedure at relatively low temperatures ({\textless}90 °C). Both the (thermo) mechanical and SH-properties of the SH-SPC prototype were experimentally validated and showed excellent performances. Macroscopic incisions in the prototype were completely healed using a SH-procedure ({\textless}70 °C). Starting from this single-cell prototype, it is straight-forward to develop a multi-cell prototype, the first SPA ever built completely out of SH-polymers.},

Mechanical tests are performed to characterize several shell folding patterns and their effect on the actuator performance.

Meanwhile, material scientists have sought compounds and fabrication strategies to devise polymeric actuators that are small, soft, adaptive, and stimuli-responsive. Merging these two fields has given birth to a new class of devices—soft microrobots that, by combining concepts from microrobotics and stimuli-responsive materials research, provide several advantages in a miniature form: external, remotely controllable power supply, adaptive motion, and human-friendly interaction, with device design and action often inspired by biological systems. Herein, recent progress in soft microrobotics is highlighted based on light-responsive liquidcrystal elastomers and polymer networks, focusing on photomobile devices such as walkers, swimmers, and mechanical oscillators, which may ultimately lead to flying microrobots. Finally, self-regulated actuation is proposed as a new pathway toward fully autonomous, intelligent light robots of the future.},

Their development faces fabrication issues due to the small dimensions and their design must take into account how physics laws behave on those length scales. Last but not least, a major issue is energy delivery and management. In this scenario, light emerges as a versatile tool for the fabrication and, even more importantly, as an energy source. Optically driven micromachines?in which optical stimuli can be efficiently converted into mechanical work?have been realized in various contexts. This Review collects recent advances in this field, focusing on optical micro robots realized in soft polymers. Starting from an overview of the photoresponsive materials that have been employed, the various designs and realizations of such devices are shown exhibiting tasks and capabilities like swimming, walking, and the manipulation of microscopic objects. In the last part, frontiers studies in the integration of polymeric structures with biological organisms are shown. In many of the reported studies, untethered operation is a key issue, seen as a fundamental requirement toward the development of smart robots that can autonomously perform tasks and respond to their environment.},

abstract = {Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90{\%} of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg-all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.},

abstract = {3D printed active composites (PACs) are a new concept in active composite design and manufacturing where one or several active materials are used as fiber materials to create active shape changing composites that are determined by the design of fibers. Recent advances in multi-material 3D printing have enabled the rapid realization of these designs, many of which would not be possible without 3D printing. In addition, the integration of active materials with 3D printing also permits the novel concept of 4D printing, where the shape of an object can change after 3D printing. In the past, using printed active composites to create origami structures was demonstrated but was limited to simple folding patterns. In this paper, we study the relationship among folding angle, fiber orientation, and applied load during programming, in order to find the optimized fiber arrangement and loading directions for complicated folding patterns. Both experiments and finite element1 simulations were performed to optimize the fiber orientations in PAC in order to achieve the desired shape change, and good agreement was achieved. FEA was then used to help the design for some complicated, self-folding, active origami structures-including a miura-ori pattern, a table, a sailboat and a crane—in which the folding occurs in different directions. The successful implementation of these complicated patterns demonstrates the capability of using printed active composites for very complicated self-folding origami designs. {\textcopyright}2017, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.},

Here we demonstrate a new reversible shape-changing component design concept enabled by 3D printing two stimuli responsive polymers-shape memory polymers and hydrogels-in prescribed 3D architectures. This approach uses the swelling of a hydrogel as the driving force for the shape change, and the temperature-dependent modulus of a shape memory polymer to regulate the time of such shape change. Controlling the temperature and aqueous environment allows switching between two stable configurations - the structures are relatively stiff and can carry load in each - without any mechanical loading and unloading. Specific shape changing scenarios, e.g., based on bending, or twisting in prescribed directions, are enabled via the controlled interplay between the active materials and the 3D printed architectures. The physical phenomena are complex and nonintuitive, and so to help understand the interplay of geometric, material, and environmental stimuli parameters we develop 3D nonlinear finite element models. Finally, we create several 2D and 3D shape changing components that demonstrate the role of key parameters and illustrate the broad application potential of the proposed approach.},

Previous fish robotic tail designs have loosely resembled the caudal fin of fishes, but have not incorporated key biomechanical components such as fin rays that can be controlled to generate complex tail conformations and motion programs similar to those seen in the locomotor repertoire of live fishes. We used this robotic caudal fin to test for the effects of fin ray stiffness, frequency and motion program on the generation of thrust and lift forces. Five different sets of fin rays were constructed to be from 150 to 2000 times the stiffness of biological fin rays, appropriately scaled for the robotic caudal fin, which had linear dimensions approximately four times larger than those of adult bluegill sunfish. Five caudal fin motion programs were identified as kinematic features of swimming behaviors in live bluegill sunfish, and were used to program the kinematic repertoire: flat movement of the entire fin, cupping of the fin, W-shaped fin motion, fin undulation and rolling movements. The robotic fin was flapped at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 Hz. All fin motions produced force in the thrust direction, and the cupping motion produced the most thrust in almost all cases. Only the undulatory motion produced lift force of similar magnitude to the thrust force. More compliant fin rays produced lower peak magnitude forces than the stiffer fin rays at the same frequency. Thrust and lift forces increased with increasing flapping frequency; thrust was maximized by the 500× stiffness fin rays and lift was maximized by the 1000× stiffness fin rays.},

However, as a result of the in-herent property of soft robotics being less rigid, the ability to control/obtain higher overall stiffness when required is yet to be further explored. In this paper, an innovative design is introduced which allows varying the stiffness of a continuum silicon-based manipulator and proves to have potential for applications in Minimally Invasive Surgery. Inspired by mus-cular structures occurring in animals such as the octopus, we propose a hybrid and inherently antagonstic actuation scheme. In particular, the octopus makes use of this principle activating two sets of muscles -longitudinal and transverse muscles -thus, being capable of controlling the stiffness of parts of its arm in an antagonistic fashion. Our designed manipulator is pneumatically actuated employing chambers embedded within the robot's silicone structure. Tendons incorporated in the structure complement the pneumatic actuation placed inside the manipulator's wall to allow variation of overall stiffness. Experiments are carried out by applying an external force in different configurations while changing the stiffness by means of the two actuation mechanisms. Our test results show that dual, antagonistic actuation increases the load bearing capabilities for soft continuum manipulators and thus their range of applications.},

abstract = {Recently, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have drawn much attention for its wide applications as artificial muscle in soft robotics, wearable devices, and biomedical engineering. One commonly adopted way to trigger deformation of LCEs is using embedded heating elements such as resistance heating wires and photothermal particles. To enable the material to recover to its unactuated state, passive and external cooling is often employed to lower the temperature, which is typically slow and environmentally sensitive. The slow and uncontrollable recovery speed of thermally driven artificial muscle often limits its applications when even moderate cyclic actuation rate is required. In this article, inspired by biology, a vascular LCE-based artificial muscle (VLAM) is designed and fabricated with internal fluidic channel in which the hot or cool water is injected to heat up or cool down the material to achieve fast actuation as well as recovery. It is demonstrated that the actuation stress, strain, and cyclic response rate of the VLAM are comparable to mammalian skeletal muscle. Because of the internal heating and cooling mechanism, VLAM shows a very robust actuating performance within a wide range of environmental temperatures. The VLAM designed in this article may also provide a convenient way to harvest waste heat to conduct mechanical work.},

Here we introduce a simple method for constructing actuating devices with programmable complex motions. Thermally responsive hydrogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and its functionalized derivatives (f-PNIPAM) were used to control the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) or the temperature at which the gel volume changes. Techniques for ultra-violet crosslinking the monomer solutions were developed to generate gel sheets with controllable crosslink density gradients that allowed bending actuation to specified curvatures by heating through the LCST. Simple molding processes were then used to construct multi-transform devices with complex shape changes, including a bioinspired artificial flower that shows blossoming and reverse blossoming with a change in temperature.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Homogeneous polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) hydrogels made from chitosan and carboxymethylcellulose were prepared in the LiOH/KOH/urea aqueous system through a freeze-thawing method. Following the treatments of sequential chemical and physical cross-linking, the resulting hydrogels with supertough mechanical strength can operate as fast response actuators under electrical stimulus in salt aqueous solutions. The electromechanical behaviors of the hydrogels are strongly dependent on experimental parameters such as electric voltage, solvent constituents, pH, and ionic strength. It is proposed that the electromechanical deformation of hydrogel originates from a dynamic osmotic equilibrium effect taking place at the interface between the hydrogel and the surrounding medium, which is induced by the migration of ions throughout the gel network. In addition, programmable 3D shape transformations were obtained by using the PEC hydrogel with designed 2D geometric patterns. Moreover, the bending actuation behavior of the PEC hydrogel can propel an adjacent object to move forward. These hydrogels are expected to be used as underwater actuators for soft robotics and other smart biomimetic systems.},

Robotic materials are multi-functional composites that tightly integrate sensing, actuation, computation and communication to create smart composites that can sense their environment and change their physical properties in an arbitrary programmable manner. Computation and communication in such materials are based on miniature, possibly wireless, devices that are scattered in the material and interface with sensors and actuators inside the material. Whereas routing and processing of information within the material build upon results from the field of sensor networks, robotic materials are pushing the limits of sensor networks in both size (down to the order of microns) and numbers of devices (up to the order of millions). In order to solve the algorithmic and systems challenges of such an approach, which will involve not only computer scientists, but also roboticists, chemists and material scientists, the community requires a common platform - much like the "Mote" that bootstrapped the widespread adoption of the field of sensor networks - that is small, provides ample of computation, is equipped with basic networking functionalities, and preferably can be powered wirelessly.},

abstract = {Folding is ubiquitous in nature with examples ranging from the formation of cellular components to winged insects. It finds technological applications including packaging of solar cells and space structures, deployable biomedical devices, and self-assembling robots and airbags. Here we demonstrate sequential self-folding structures realized by thermal activation of spatially-variable patterns that are 3D printed with digital shape memory polymers, which are digital materials with different shape memory behaviors. The time-dependent behavior of each polymer allows the temporal sequencing of activation when the structure is subjected to a uniform temperature. This is demonstrated via a series of 3D printed structures that respond rapidly to a thermal stimulus, and self-fold to specified shapes in controlled shape changing sequences. Measurements of the spatial and temporal nature of self-folding structures are in good agreement with the companion finite element simulations. A simplified reduced-order model is also developed to rapidly and accurately describe the self-folding physics. An important aspect of self-folding is the management of self-collisions, where different portions of the folding structure contact and then block further folding. A metric is developed to predict collisions and is used together with the reduced-order model to design self-folding structures that lock themselves into stable desired configurations.},

abstract = {Many environmental conditions can influence the mechanical characteristics of the glucose-sensitive hydrogels. In this paper, a multi-effect-coupling glucose-stimulus (MECglu) model is developed to study the influence of environmental solution pH on the swelling behavior of soft smart hydrogels responding to change in surrounding blood glucose concentration. In order to characterize the chemo-electro-mechanical behaviors of the hydrogels, the model is composed of the Nernst-Planck type of diffusion-reaction partial differential equations for mobile species with consideration of the enzyme reaction catalyzed by the glucose oxidase and the catalase, the Poisson equation for electric potential, and the nonlinear equilibrium equation for mechanical large deformation of the glucose-sensitive hydrogel. In the MECglu model, the formulation of the fixed charge groups bound onto the corsslinked polymeric network is associated with the change of the ambient solution pH. Using these nonlinear coupled partial differential equations, we demonstrate that the computational mechanical deformation by the MECglu model consists well with the experimental observations published in the range of practical physiological glucose concentration from 0 to 16.5 mm (300 mg/ml). The simulations are also carried out for analysis of the influences of physiological pH on the distributive profiles of reacting and diffusive species concentrations and the electric potential as well as the mechanical deformation of the glucose-sensitive hydrogels. The simulations by the model can efficiently support the design and optimization of the insulin delivery system based on the glucose-sensitive hydrogels with the immobilized glucose oxidase and catalase. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Various robotic applications including surgical instruments, wearable robots and autonomous mobile robots are often constrained with strict design requirements on high degrees of freedom (DoF) and minimal volume and weight. An intuitive design to meet these contradictory requirements is to embed locking mechanism in under actuated robotic manipulators to direct the actuation from a single and remote source to drive different joints on demand. Mechanical clutches do serve such purposes but often are bulky and require auxiliary mechanism making it difficult to justify the high cost adding the additional DoF, especially in cm scale. Here, we introduce an under-actuated robotic arm with shape memory polymer (SMP) joints. Through controlling the temperature, the stiffness of the joints can be adjusted and selected joints will be activated while the rest are fixed in their position. The presented prototype can control the joints independently with a coupled actuation from two stepper motors. Since we have redundant DoFs in the arm, there can be more than one configuration to reach a given position. We use a probabilistic technique to determine the optimum configuration with the minimum number of active joints that can yield the desired posture. In this paper, we report on the performance of the proposed design for the hardware and the configuration planner.},

However, a generalized physical understanding of origami remains elusive, owing to the challenge of determining whether local kinematic constraints are globally compatible and to an incomplete understanding of how the folded sheet's material properties contribute to the overall mechanical response. Here, we show that the traditional square twist, whose crease pattern has zero degrees of freedom (DOF) and therefore should not be foldable, can nevertheless be folded by accessing bending deformations that are not explicit in the crease pattern. These hidden bending DOF are separated from the crease DOF by an energy gap that gives rise to a geometrically driven critical bifurcation between mono- and bistability. Noting its potential utility for fabricating mechanical switches, we use a temperature-responsive polymer-gel version of the square twist to demonstrate hysteretic folding dynamics at the sub-millimetre scale.},

The development for stretchable conductors has been highly motivated with different approaches established to address the dilemma in the conductivity and stretchability trade-offs to some extent. Here, a new strategy to achieve superelastic conductors with high conductivity and stable electrical performance under stretching is reported. It is demonstrated that by electrically anchoring conductive fillers with eutectic gallium indium particles (EGaInPs), significant improvement in stretchability and durability can be achieved in stretchable conductors. Different from the strategy of modulating the chemical interactions between the conductive fillers and host polymers, the EGaInPs provide dynamic and robust electrical anchors between the conductive fillers. A superelastic conductor which can achieve a high stretchability with 1000{\%} strain at initial conductivity of 8331 S cm -1 and excellent cycling durability with about eight times resistance change (compared to the initial resistance at 0{\%} strain before stretching) after reversibly stretching to 800{\%} strain for 10 000 times is demonstrated. Applications of the superelastic conductor in an interactive soft touch device and a stretchable light-emitting system are also demonstrated, featuring its promising applications in soft robotics or soft and interactive human-machine interfaces.},

We suggest that, during the polymerization in the mixed solvent, the polymer chains get widely expanded, which leads to an expanded structure and a large swelling ratio (SR) of the gel in water at room temperature. From the standpoint of entropy, the expanded structure may decrease the total entropy of gel system (including the polymer chains and water molecules around them) at the swollen state, which makes this gel system yearn to collapse and undergo phase separation as the temperature gets increased. On the other hand, due to the macroporous matrix of the expanded gel, the water can diffuse out/in easily and quickly during the shrinking/reswelling process as the temperature cycles around the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Exciting new robots are being developed that will operate in a different environment from traditional industrial factories or research laboratories. Researchers are working worldwide to create robots that are integrated into our daily lives. For the advancement of these new robots, compliant, safe, and new actuators are one of the important issues turning energy into safe motion. The biological counterpart is the muscle tendon structure that has functional performance characteristics and a neuromechanical control systemthat has far more superior capabilities. The superior power to weight ratio, force to weight ratio, and sensing characteristics limit the development of machines that can match motion, safety, and energy efficiency of a human or other animal. One of the key differences of biological systems is their adaptable compliance or variable stiffness compared with the traditional stiff electrical drives used for the standard industrial robotic applications, which require accurate, reference-trajectory tracking.More and more applications such as robots in close human or robot proximity, legged autonomous robots, and rehabilitation devices and prostheses demand a different set of design specifications, for which the use of compliant actuators can be beneficial as compared with the traditional stiff actuation schemes. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Here we present a new 4D printing technique capable of producing a diverse range of trilayer constructs using commercial low-cost desktop 3D printers. This unique methodology permits the viable construction of dynamically robust and complex origami architectures for a new generation of active structures. The resulting creations transform from flat 2D parts to 3D structures through submersion in water and return to their original configuration through dehydration. This technique uses commercially available materials and printers to enable a 4D printing method that is more accessible and affordable than previous examples of hydration triggered 4D printing. This method yields a controlled and predictable actuation route and final shape, enabling it to be used for both simple and complex origami inspired designs, such as the tessellated waterbomb origami pattern, a design that has not previously been realised with 4D printing. These new designs demonstrate how the integration of multiple trilayers into a single 3D print enables through-thickness control of actuation and resulting formation of active structures with complexity beyond what has previously been achieved with 4D printing.},

In most cases hydrogels were obtained in high yields and their swelling degree showed a significant dependence with the solvent used in the synthesis. When HGs were synthesized in water/ethanol mixture, the maximum equilibrium swelling (Seq) was reached when the water/ethanol ratio was 60/40(V/V), while for water/DMSO it was obtained for a water/DMSO ratio 80/20. In both cases, these swelling values were higher than when the HGs were synthesized in pure water. The swelling degree achieved by the HGs in water/ethanol was directly related to the yields and the pore size, but this behavior was not observed for the HGs obtained in water/DMSO. In all cases the HGs obtained in water/DMSO swell more than those obtained in water/ethanol. On the other hand, the molar mass of the PAAm polymers prepared in the same reaction conditions, decrease as the proportion of ethanol or DMSO increase. However, the molar mass reached by the polymers obtained in water/DMSO were higher than those obtained in water/ethanol.},

The governing equation of the flexible tail was derived by using the Euler-Bernoulli theory. In this equation, the resistive forces were estimated as a term analogous to viscous damping. Then, the modal analysis method was applied in order to derive an analytical solution of the governing equation, by which the relationship between the driving moment and the lateral movement of the flexible tail was described. Finally, simulations and experiments were carried out and the results were compared to verify the accuracy of the dynamic model. It was proved that the dynamic model of a fish robot with a flexible tail fin well explains the real behavior of robotic fish in underwater environment. {\textcopyright}2013 Jilin University.},

abstract = {Soft microrobots based on photoresponsive materials and controlled by light fields can generate a variety of different gaits. This inherent flexibility can be exploited to maximize their locomotion performance in a given environment and used to adapt them to changing conditions. Albeit, because of the lack of accurate locomotion models, and given the intrinsic variability among microrobots, analytical control design is not possible. Common data-driven approaches, on the other hand, require running prohibitive numbers of experiments and lead to very sample-specific results. Here we propose a probabilistic learning approach for light-controlled soft microrobots based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Processes (GPs). The proposed approach results in a learning scheme that is data-efficient, enabling gait optimization with a limited experimental budget, and robust against differences among microrobot samples. These features are obtained by designing the learning scheme through the comparison of different GP priors and BO settings on a semi-synthetic data set. The developed learning scheme is validated in microrobot experiments, resulting in a 115{\%} improvement in a microrobot's locomotion performance with an experimental budget of only 20 tests. These encouraging results lead the way toward self-adaptive microrobotic systems based on light-controlled soft microrobots and probabilistic learning control.},

This article describes a new principle for designing soft or 'semisoft' pneumatic actuators: SLiT (for SLit-in-Tube) actuators. Inflating an elastomeric balloon, when enclosed by an external shell (a material with higher Young's modulus) containing slits of different directions and lengths, produces a variety of motions, including bending, twisting, contraction, and elongation. The requisite pressure for actuation depends on the length of the slits, and this dependence allows sequential actuation by controlling the applied pressure. Different actuators can also be controlled using external "sliders" that act as reprogrammable "on-off" switches. A pneumatic arm and a walker constructed from SLiT actuators demonstrate their ease of fabrication and the range of motions they can achieve.},

Our numerical models developed using the finite element method can predict the actuator behavior at large mechanical strains to allow efficient design iterations for system optimization. Based on two distinctive actuator prototypes' (linear and bending actuators) experimental results that include free displacement and blocked-forces, we have validated the efficacy of the numerical models. The presented extensive investigation of mechanical performance for soft actuators with varying geometric parameters demonstrates the practical application of the design tool, and the robustness of the actuator hardware design, towards diverse soft robotic systems for a wide set of assistive wearable technologies, including replicating the motion of several parts of the human body.},

In comparison to many prior grasp analysis tools, the tool presented here models the dynamics of a hand, including actuation mechanisms, compliance and friction in an efficient formulation that permits one to evaluate variations in such quantities as phalange length, finger spacing, transmission ratios, and torsional joint stiffness when comparing hand designs.

abstract = {The octopus is a marine animal whose body has no rigid structures. It has eight arms composed of a peculiar muscular structure, named a muscular hydrostat. The octopus arms provide it with both locomotion and grasping capabilities, thanks to the fact that their stiffness can change over a wide range and can be controlled through combined contractions of the muscles. The muscular hydrostat can better be seen as a modifiable skeleton. Furthermore, the morphology the arms and the mechanical characteristics of their tissues are such that the interaction with the environment (i.e., water) is exploited to simplify control. Thanks to this effective mechanism of embodied intelligence, the octopus can control a very high number of degrees of freedom, with relatively limited computing resources. From these considerations, the octopus emerges as a good model for embodied intelligence and for soft robotics. The prototype of a robot arm has been built based on an artificial muscular hydrostat inspired to the muscular hydrostat of the Octopus vulgaris. The prototype presents the morphology of the biological model and the broad arrangement of longitudinal and transverse muscles. Actuation is obtained with cables (longitudinally) and with shape memory alloy springs (transversally). The robot arm combines contractions and it can show the basic movements of the octopus arm, like elongation, shortening and bending, in water. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to design and manufacture a 3D range-modulator for scanned particle therapy. The modulator is intended to create a highly conformal dose distribution with only one fixed energy, simultaneously reducing considerably the treatment time. As a proof of concept, a 3D range-modulator was developed for a spherical target volume with a diameter of 5 cm, placed at a depth of 25 cm in a water phantom. It consists of a large number of thin pins with a well-defined shape and different lengths to modulate the necessary shift of the Bragg peak. The 3D range-modulator was manufactured with a rapid prototyping technique. The FLUKA Monte Carlo package was used to simulate the modulating effect of the 3D rangemodulator and the resulting dose distribution. For that purpose, a special user routine was implemented to handle its complex geometrical contour. Additionally, FLUKA was extended with the capability of intensity modulated scanning. To validate the simulation results, dose measurements were carried out at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center with a 400.41 MeV/u 12C beam. The high resolution dosimetric measurements show a good agreement between simulated and measured dose distributions. Irradiation of the monoenergetic raster plan took 3 seconds, which is approximately 20 times shorter than a comparable plan with 16 different energies. The combination of only one energy and a 3D range-modulator leads to a tremendous decrease in irradiation time. “Interplay effects”, typical for moving targets and pencil beam scanning, can be immensely reduced or disappear completely, making the delivery of a homogeneous dose to moving targets more reliable. Combining high dose conformity, very good homogeneity and extremely short irradiation times, the 3D rangemodulator is considered to become a clinically applicable method for very fast treatment of lung tumours.},

abstract = {This presentation will review and evaluate key evidence for the link between violent behavior and psychotic symptoms in general, and delusions in particular. The presenter will reexamine conflicting findings for the “threat/control-override” and “rationality-within-irrationality” hypotheses that emerged in the 1990s, focusing in detail on comparative evidence from the MacArthur Violence Risk Study and the more recent Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) from the USA. That delusions directly cause violence in schizophrenia has been widely assumed, yet remains contested in the literatures of psychiatry and its neighboring sciences. Populations with psychosis are heterogeneous, manifesting the full range of risk and protective factors for violence. For every threatening delusional patient, clinicians in nonforensic settings may see 9 who will not harm. Epidemiological studies describe violence in mental illness as a multi-factorial problem, with salient predictors including age, gender, substance abuse, social disadvantage, developmental history, victimization and trauma sequelae, and exposure to community violence. Clinical studies of aggression implicate other types of symptoms-such as explosive anger, impulsivity, dysregulated mood, psychoactive drug effects, and antisocial personality-that may combine with delusions to exacerbate or mediate their impact on violence risk. These other vectors of violence provide a context and a matrix within which to understand the role of delusions in precipitating aggressive and violent acts. Psychopathology may contribute to assaultive acts, but is rarely, if ever, the sufficient explanation for them. The lecture concludes with general implications for antipsychotic pharmacotherapy, involuntary treatment law, criminal justice, and policy in behavioral healthcare services delivery.},

abstract = {Living nature and human technology apply different principles to create hard, strong and tough materials. In this review, we compare and discuss prominent aspects of these alternative strategies, and demonstrate for selected examples that nanoscale-precision biotemplating is able to produce uncommon mechanical properties as well as actuating behavior, resembling to some extent the properties of the original natural templates. We present and discuss mechanical testing data showing for the first time that nanometer-precision biotemplating can lead to porous ceramic materials with deformation characteristics commonly associated with either biological or highly advanced technical materials. We also review recent findings on the relation between hierarchical structuring and humidity-induced directional motion. Finally, we discuss to which extent the observed behavior is in agreement with previous results and theories on the mechanical properties of multiscale hierarchical materials, as well as studies of highly disperse technical materials, together with an outlook for further lines of investigation.},

abstract = {The field of active origami explores the incorporation of active materials into origami-inspired structures in order to serve as a means of actuation. Active origami-inspired structures capable of folding into complex three-dimensional (3D) shapes have the potential to be lightweight and versatile compared to traditional methods of actuation. This paper details the finite element analysis and experimental validation of unimorph actuators. Actuators are fabricated by adhering layers of electroded dielectric elastomer (3M VHB F9473PC) onto a passive substrate layer (3M Magic Scotch Tape). Finite element analysis of the actuators simulates the electromechanical coupling of the dielectric elastomer under an applied voltage by applying pressures to the surfaces of the dielectric elastomer where the compliant electrode (conductive carbon grease) is present. 3D finite element analysis of the bending actuators shows that applying contact boundary conditions to the electroded region of the active and passive layers provides better agreement to experimental data compared to modeling the entire actuator as continuous. To improve the applicability of dielectric elastomer-based actuators for active origami-inspired structures, folding actuators are developed by taking advantage of localized deformation caused by a passive layer with non-uniform thickness. Two-dimensional analysis of the folding actuators shows that agreement to experimental data diminishes as localized deformation increases. Limitations of using pressures to approximate the electromechanical coupling of the dielectric elastomer under an applied electric field and additional modeling considerations are also discussed.},

abstract = {Animals exploit the deformability of soft structures to move efficiently in complex natural environments. These soft structures are inherently compliant and enable large strains in components not typically found in robotics. Such capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. One goal in soft robotics is to endow robots with new, bioinspired features that permit morphologically adaptive interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review three key elements of bioinspired soft robots from a mechanics vantage point, namely, materials selection, actuation, and design. Soft materials are necessary for safe interaction and overall actuation of bio-inspired robots. The intrinsic properties of materials in soft robots allow for an “embodied intelligence” that can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity in ways not possible with rigid-bodied robots Finally, soft robotics can be combined with tissue engineering and synthetic biology to create bio-hybrid systems with unique sensing, dynamic response, and mobility. Bioinspired soft robots have the ability to also expedite the evolution of co-robots that can safely interact with humans.},

abstract = {Materials that respond rapidly and reversibly to external stimuli currently stand among the top choices as actuators for real-world applications. Here, a series of programmable actuators fabricated as single- or bilayer elements is described that can reversibly respond to minute concentrations of acetone vapors. By using templates, microchannel structures are replicated onto the surface of two highly elastic polymers, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyvinyl alcohol, to induce chiral coiling upon exposure to acetone vapors. The vapomechanical coiling is reversible and can be conducted repeatedly over 100 times without apparent fatigue. If they are immersed in liquid acetone, the actuators are saturated with the solvent and temporarily lose their motility but regain their shape and activity within seconds after the solvent evaporates. The desorption of acetone from the PVDF layer is four times faster than its adsorption, and the actuator composed of a single PVDF layer maintains its ability to move over an acetone-soaked filter paper even after several days. The controllable and reproducible sensing capability of this smart material can be utilized for actuating dynamic elements in soft robotics.},

Here we present a theory for the simplest such structure: an annular circular strip that is folded along a central circular curve to form a three-dimensional buckled structure driven by geometrical frustration. We quantify this shape in terms of the radius of the circle, the dihedral angle of the fold and the mechanical properties of the sheet of paper and the fold itself. When the sheet is isometrically deformed everywhere except along the fold itself, stiff folds result in creases with constant curvature and oscillatory torsion. However, relatively softer folds inherit the broken symmetry of the buckled shape with oscillatory curvature and torsion. Our asymptotic analysis of the isometrically deformed state is corroborated by numerical simulations which allow us to generalize our analysis to study multiply folded structures.},

In particular, magnetic fields offer a safe and effective manipulation method for biomedical applications, which typically require remote actuation in enclosed and confined spaces 8-10. With advances in magnetic field control 11, magnetically responsive soft materials have also evolved from embedding discrete magnets 12 or incorporating magnetic particles 13 into soft compounds to generating nonuniform magnetization profiles in polymeric sheets 14,15. Here we report 3D printing of programmed ferromagnetic domains in soft materials that enable fast transformations between complex 3D shapes via magnetic actuation. Our approach is based on direct ink writing 16 of an elastomer composite containing ferromagnetic microparticles. By applying a magnetic field to the dispensing nozzle while printing 17, we reorient particles along the applied field to impart patterned magnetic polarity to printed filaments. This method allows us to program ferromagnetic domains in complex 3D-printed soft materials, enabling a set of previously inaccessible modes of transformation, such as remotely controlled auxetic behaviours of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios. The actuation speed and power density of our printed soft materials with programmed ferromagnetic domains are orders of magnitude greater than existing 3D-printed active materials. We further demonstrate diverse functions derived from complex shape changes, including reconfigurable soft electronics, a mechanical metamaterial that can jump and a soft robot that crawls, rolls, catches fast-moving objects and transports a pharmaceutical dose.},

abstract = {Four types of three-dimensional (3-D) metallic metamaterials with tailorable thermo-mechanical properties are designed. For the first three types, the structure-property relations are studied by adjusting design parameters including two length parameters, one angle parameter and two material combinations. For the fourth type, one additional angle parameter is involved. It is shown that each of the four types of metamaterials designed exhibits the cubic symmetry and thus needs three independent elastic constants to characterize its elastic behavior and one coefficient of thermal expansion to describe its isotropic thermal expansion. The effects of the design parameters on the effective Poisson's ratio (PR), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus, shear modulus and the relative density are systematically investigated for each of the four types of designed metamaterials by using unit cell-based finite element simulations that incorporate periodic boundary conditions. It is found that 3-D metallic metamaterials with positive, near-zero or negative PR and CTE can be obtained by tailoring the bi-material lattice structures and material combinations. Also, it is revealed that metamaterial {\#} 1 can achieve both a negative PR and a non-positive CTE while maintaining a high stiffness and a low relative density (and thus a lightweight). The good tunability of thermo-mechanical properties of the four types of metamaterials provides an avenue of enabling the expansion of Ashby's material chart to produce more material options for engineering applications.},

Experimental flow-visualization techniques have been employed to obtain the unsteady two-dimensional velocity fields around the straight-line swimming motions and a 60 degrees turn of the fish in the centerline plane of the fish depth. A three-dimensional numerical method is also employed to predict the total velocity field through simulation. Comparison of the experimental and numerical velocity and vorticity fields shows good agreement. The fish morphology, with its narrow peduncle region, allows for smooth flow into the articulated tail, which is able to sustain a large load for thrust generation. Streamlines of the flow detail complex processes that enhance the efficiency of flow actuation by the tail. The fish benefits from smooth near-body flow patterns and the generation of controlled body-bound vorticity, which is propagated towards the tail, shed prior to the peduncle region and then manipulated by the caudal fin to form large-scale vortical structures with minimum wasted energy. This manipulation of body-generated vorticity and its interaction with the vorticity generated by the oscillating caudal fin are fundamental to the propulsion and maneuvering capabilities of fish.},

abstract = {Soft microrobots based on photoresponsive materials and controlled by light fields can generate a variety of different gaits. This inherent flexibility can be exploited to maximize their locomotion performance in a given environment and used to adapt them to changing conditions. Albeit, because of the lack of accurate locomotion models, and given the intrinsic variability among microrobots, analytical control design is not possible. Common data-driven approaches, on the other hand, require running prohibitive numbers of experiments and lead to very sample-specific results. Here we propose a probabilistic learning approach for light-controlled soft microrobots based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Processes (GPs). The proposed approach results in a learning scheme that is data-efficient, enabling gait optimization with a limited experimental budget, and robust against differences among microrobot samples. These features are obtained by designing the learning scheme through the comparison of different GP priors and BO settings on a semi-synthetic data set. The developed learning scheme is validated in microrobot experiments, resulting in a 115{\%} improvement in a microrobot's locomotion performance with an experimental budget of only 20 tests. These encouraging results lead the way toward self-adaptive microrobotic systems based on light-controlled soft microrobots and probabilistic learning control.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Crosslinked polymers and gels are important in soft robotics, solar vapor generation, energy storage, drug delivery, catalysis, and biosensing. However, their attractive mass transport and volume‐changing abilities are diffusion‐limited, requiring miniaturization to avoid slow response. Typical approaches to improving diffusion in hydrogels sacrifice mechanical properties by increasing porosity or limit the total volumetric flux by directionally confining the pores. Despite tremendous efforts, simultaneous enhancement of diffusion and mechanical properties remains a long‐standing challenge hindering broader practical applications of hydrogels. In this work, cononsolvency photopolymerization is developed as a universal approach to overcome this swelling–mechanical property trade‐off. The as‐synthesized poly({\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}‐isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel, as an exemplary system, presents a unique open porous network with continuous microchannels, leading to record‐high volumetric (de)swelling speeds, almost an order of magnitude higher than reported previously. This swelling enhancement comes with a simultaneous improvement in Young's modulus and toughness over conventional hydrogels fabricated in pure solvents. The resulting fast mass transport enables in‐air operation of the hydrogel via rapid water replenishment and ultrafast actuation. The method is compatible with 3D printing. The generalizability is demonstrated by extending the technique to poly({\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}‐tertbutylacrylamide{\textless}i{\textgreater}‐co‐{\textless}/i{\textgreater}polyacrylamide) and polyacrylamide hydrogels, non‐temperature‐responsive polymer systems, validating the present hypothesis that cononsolvency is a generic phenomenon driven by competitive adsorption.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The design strategy is to anchor the long-chain polymer networks of tough hydrogels covalently to non-porous solid surfaces, which can be achieved by the silanation of such surfaces.

The hydrogels synthesized in water can have the microscopic inhomogeneous network arising from the entanglement of polymer chains, while the hydrogels synthesized in amphiphilic solvents can have the homogeneous network arising from the polymer concentration lower than the pre-gel solution and can be similar in network structure to the lightly crosslinked hydrogel synthesized in water. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Miniature soft robots offer excellent safety and deformability, which are highly desirable in applications such as navigation in confined areas or the manipulation of microscale objects. However, it is difficult to manufacture such robots using traditional processes due to the complexity of their design. While rapidly advancing 3D printing technologies offer manufacturing flexibility, it is still challenging to fabricate soft pneumatic robots on millimeter scales due to the difficulty in making microscale voids and channels, which are essential for pneumatic actuation. A generic process flow for systematic and efficient tailoring of the material formulation and key processing parameters for digital light processing-based 3D printing of miniature pneumatic actuators for soft robots is presented. The process flow includes selection of photoabsorber and material performance characterization to determine the appropriate material formulation and characterizations for curing depth and XY fidelity to identify the combination of exposure time and sliced layer thickness. By applying the tailored results to a self-built multimaterial 3D printing system, an assortment of miniature soft pneumatic robots with various structures and morphing modes are printed. Furthermore, potential applications of printed miniature actuators are exemplified by a soft debris remover that navigates in a confined space and collects small objects in a hard-to-reach position.},

@article{Westbrook2008,
abstract = {Environmentally responsive (ER) hydrogels are hydrogels that can experience an abrupt volume change and hence hold or release a large amount of water under the change of certain environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, or an electric field. Because of their unique capability to achieve a large yet reversible volume change, hydrogels have been widely used in microfluidics and biomedical applications, such as hydrogel sensors and actuators for microfluidic channels, novel drug delivery systems, and scaffolding materials for tissue engineering. In most applications, ER hydrogels are used to create an isotropic volume change or one-dimensional motion by constraining the hydrogel in the other two directions. In this study, using finite element based simulations, actuator designs are demonstrated that can generate a variety of shape changes by carefully patterning ER hydrogels on a non-ER hydrogel matrix. In these designs, as the environment changes, the ER hydrogels undergo volume change under the constraints imposed by the non-ER matrix, causing an eigenstrain (mismatch strain) and hence the deformation of the non-ER matrix. By properly controlling the locations of the ER hydrogel sections with respect to the non-ER hydrogel matrix, one can achieve a desired deformation of the composite structure. As examples, designs of a single material actuator, one linear spring composite actuator, and two coil composite actuators are demonstrated. The feasibility to produce these actuators and the possible applications are discussed at the end of the article.},

Our survey covers the period from 1994—when the first WebAL work appeared—up to the present day, together with a brief discussion of relevant precursors. We examine recent projects, from 2010–2015, in greater detail in order to highlight the current state of the art. We follow the survey with a discussion of common themes and methodologies that can be observed in recent work and identify a number of likely directions for future work in this exciting area.},

@article{Stokes2014,
abstract = {This article describes a hybrid robotic system combining hard and soft subsystems. This hybrid comprises a wheeled robot (an iRobot Create; hard) and a four-legged quadruped (soft). It is capable (using a simple, wireless control system) of rapid locomotion over flat terrain (using the wheeled hard robot) and of gripping and retrieving an object (using the independent locomotive capabilities of the soft robot). The utility of this system is demonstrated by performing a mission requiring the capabilities of both components: retrieving an object (iPod Nano) from the center of a room. This class of robot—hybrids comprising hard and soft systems functioning synergistically—is capable of performing tasks that neither can do alone. In contrast to specialized hard robotic arms with grippers (capable of performing some of the functions we describe here), which are complex, rela-tively expensive, and require sophisticated controls, this hybrid system is easy to construct, simple to control, and low in cost. The soft robotic system in the hybrid is lightweight, disposable if contaminated or damaged, and capable of multiple functions.},

@article{Cheng1981,
abstract = {We consider the problem of maximizing the integral stiffness of solid elastic plates described by thin plate theory. Assuming the material volume and plate domain to be given, we use the plate thickness function as the design variable and take both maximum and minimum allowable thickness values into account. On the basis of a convenient tensorial formulation of the problem, where the governing equations are derived by variational analysis and constitute necessary conditions for stationarity, we develop an efficient and quite general numerical algorithm by means of which a number of stationary solutions for rectangular and axisymmetric annular plates with various boundary conditions are obtained. These numerical results enable us to investigate the optimization problem itself in terms of its major parameters, particularly the maximum and minimum values specified for the plate thickness. For problems associated with large ratios between these constraint values, plate designs with significant integral stiffeners are obtained. We find however, that these designs are only local optima and that a global optimal plate thickness function does generally neither exist within the class of smooth functions nor within the class of smooth functions with a finite number of discontinuities. In order to determine a global optimal solution associated with given thickness constraint values, it is therefore necessary to change the optimal design formulation. With implications for a number of similar two-dimensional optimization problems, our results offer valuable indications of the lines along which such changes should be performed. {\textcopyright}1981.},

Conventional flexure joints utilize bending as the primary mechanism of deformation. In contrast, the split-tube flexure joint incorporates torsion as the primary mode of deformation, and contrasts the torsional properties of a thin-walled open-section member with the bending properties of that member to obtain desirable joint behavior. The development of this joint enables the development of compliant mechanisms that are quite compliant along kinematic axes, extremely stiff along structural axes„and are capable of kinematically well-behaved large motions.},
